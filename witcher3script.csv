name,line
Geralt, You know I don't find that amusing.
Yennefer," It wasn't meant to amuse, but to prod you to hurry. It's midday"
Geralt, Pfff...
Yennefer," You promised Ciri you'd train with her. Go, before Vesemir bores her"
Geralt," So...later, then?"
Yennefer, Mhm. See you later.
Geralt," See, I thought Ciri could stand to wait a little longer."
Yennefer, It's uninstructive. Not to mention unreasonable.
Geralt, I missed you. A lot.
Yennefer, And I missed you. But we have plenty of time to make up for that.
Geralt, I don't want to be reasonable.
Yennefer, Aha! So that's the way the wind blows...
Geralt," Ahh, yeah. Better go see Ciri."
Yennefer, Go and train with her. Then come back. It'll give me a chance to put
Geralt," Of all the women I've known, you're the only one who does that"
Yennefer, You've known many?
Geralt, What's it matter? Only ever thought of you...
Yennefer, Mhm. Undergarments.
Yennefer, Gold clashes with my complexion. You should know that.
Yennefer, I know. You might bring me some more once you're done training.
Yennefer," Geralt, stop fingering my toiletries."
Geralt," Old witcher's fast asleep... Ciri's disappeared somewhere, of course."
Geralt, Guess she prefers practice to theory...
Vesemir, Hm? What?
Geralt," Time to wake up, master. These lessons so boring they put you to sleep,"
Vesemir," Dammit... Had her taking notes on ""Ghouls and Alghouls""... Wanted to"
Geralt, Huh. Making her slog through that brick? No wonder she took off.
Vesemir," John of Brugge lacks flair, true, bue he's reliable. Not like the"
Geralt, Don't get mad at her.
Vesemir, Why the hell not? The whippersnapper refuses to do as she's told.
Geralt, You like that about her.
Geralt, Gotta admit we've spoiled her.
Vesemir," ""We've"" spoiled her? I've been saying from the start -- Ciri needs a"
Geralt," Been saying that, true. But you let her walk over you just like the"
Vesemir," Hm. Fine, I suppose I'm partly to blame. But this has to end. Now."
Geralt, Wrong.
Geralt, Now I see why you were so eager to practice. Strike!
Ciri, Ha!
Geralt, You're not in the circus. Pirouette! Wrong. Footwork! Enough. Get down.
Ciri, With a flip?
Geralt, What do you think?
Geralt," All right, take off the blindfold. You've got work to do. Your reflexes"
Ciri, Maybe for a witcher.
Geralt, Think drowners or strigas will go easy on you because you haven't
Ciri," Well, yes, but...that book was horribly dull!"
Geralt, I know. And you know it's no excuse.
Ciri, Ugh. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
Geralt," Sorry's not good enough. You're gonna read ""Ghouls and Alghouls"" in"
Ciri," No, please...I'd rather clean the stables!"
Geralt, End of discussion.
Geralt," Better not. Vesemir says if it does, he'll make you eat a bowl of"
Ciri, Hahaha. Eeewwww!
Geralt, Exactly. So you'd best behave.
Geralt, Come on. We'll practice with the others down below.
Ciri, Shall we run the walls?
Geralt, Of course. This a witcher school or an elven bathhouse?
Geralt," Not this time. Believe me, you don't want to keep Vesemir waiting."
Ciri, Beat you to the bottom!
Geralt, Hah. Maybe if you fall. What did I tell you about breathing? Through
Ciri, Huhhh... Huhhh... Huhhh...
Geralt, Ciri. Cut it out.
Ciri, Run into trouble? Should I turn back and help you?!
Ciri, Hey! You said we weren't allowed to do that!
Geralt, I said you weren't allowed to do it.
Geralt, I win.
Ciri, Your legs are longer! I'll show you yet -- just need to grow a bit!
Ciri, First! Hehe. Na-na-na-na-naaa!
Ciri, Oh no... Vesemir's got that look.
Geralt, What'd you expect?
Vesemir," Anything to say for yourself, young lady?"
Ciri," I'm very sorry, Uncle Vesemir."
Vesemir," Young blood craves action, I understand that. But when you fight a"
Ciri," ...""by markings, like unto the panthera tigris that in Zerrikania dwells,"
Vesemir," Hmm. So you did read the chapter. Still, you should've asked if..."
Ciri," But you were asleep, Uncle Vesemir."
Geralt, Don't try to weasel your way out of this.
Ciri," ""A witcher must know how to trick his opponent."" You said so yourself."
Geralt," Might've. But don't use my words of wisdom on Vesemir, got it? That's"
Geralt, So you did the reading. Why not admit it right off?
Ciri," ""Never pounce on an advantage as soon as it appears. Wait till it"
Vesemir," Well, you're a quick study. Quick, but mischievous."
Vesemir," Fine, we've talked enough. Geralt, you're with me. Lambert, you're"
Ciri, Huh... Again?
Vesemir, Stop groaning and grab a sword!
Vesemir, What do you think -- should we start by reviewing the fundamentals or
Geralt, Should work on the basics. Even skilled masters need to hone the
Vesemir," Draw your sword, Geralt! Quick cuts! One, two, three! Strong strikes"
Geralt," Position, Ciri! Footwork! Remember!"
Vesemir," Now -- parrying, Ciri, see how Geralt holds his sword? Its angle?"
Ciri, What am I supposed to parry? I'm fighting a stupid dummy.
Vesemir," Pretend now, live later! Riposte. Strike, counter-strike! Now,"
Geralt, Let's skip to free training. No point going over the basics again.
Lambert," Whooaaa, you really showed him, kid!"
Geralt," Ciri, get down here!"
Vesemir," Huh, the little she-devil. Soon as she's back, we'll set her to"
Geralt," Find that helmet?! Ciri?! Ugh, I'll make sure to find every last blade"
Geralt, What the...?
Geralt, Vesemir!
Geralt, Noooooo!!!
Vesemir, You all right?
Geralt, Mhm. Had a nightmare...
Vesemir, About...
Geralt, Take forever to explain.
Vesemir, Dawn's some way off. We've got time.
Geralt," Started in the guest room at Kaer Morhen. I was relaxing in the tub,"
Vesemir, Triss?
Geralt," Yennefer. Funny, isn't it? She's never been there. Seemed so real in"
Vesemir, Was she nagging you about something?
Geralt, Hm. Mhm.
Vesemir," True to life, indeed. We'll find her."
Geralt," In the dream, I went and found Ciri. Then we trained."
Vesemir," Those were the days... Hm, little she-devil. I've trained kids who"
Geralt," No. The Wild Hunt appeared, attacked Ciri... I couldn't move. Stood"
Vesemir, It was just a dream.
Geralt, Be dawning soon. Time to go.
Geralt," That's the problem -- it was more. In the past, when Ciri'd"
Vesemir," We taught her how to defend herself from anything, wraiths"
Geralt, I know we will. That's not what worries me. You've seen her tracks.
Vesemir, Be surprised if she wasn't in trouble. She always poked her nose
Geralt," Don't know. Guess I thought, once we were finally reunited, things"
Vesemir, Calm? With Yennefer? Hmph. Good luck.
Geralt, Rather not talk about it.
Vesemir, Gotcha.
Geralt, So...time to hit the road?
Vesemir," Wait. Show me the letter from Yennefer, might've overlooked some hint"
Geralt, Didn't overlook anything. We were meant to meet in Willoughby -- that's
Vesemir," Stop talking and give me the letter. Well, how about that! It does"
Geralt," You were gonna read it, not sniff it."
Vesemir," ""We must meet. Soon""...""Willoughby, near Vizima""... Hm, nothing else"
Geralt, That's private. Very private.
Vesemir," A-ha...I understand. At least I think I do. Maybe not entirely,"
Geralt, Stuffed unicorn. Used it once or twice. In certain...situations.
Vesemir, Hm! The things young folk get up to these days...
Geralt, Back on topic. How's it look -- how far behind Yennefer are we?
Vesemir," Two, three days... Trail's fresh. But it looks like it leads toward"
Vesemir, Wait -- hear that?
Geralt," I hear it, I smell it. Ghouls."
Vesemir," Of course, when armies pass, necrophages follow. Let's go before any"
Geralt, I ever tell you about this sorcerer I knew? Couldn't stop talking about
Vesemir, Because you can brew potions from their blood?
Geralt," Heh, no. Because by eating rotting corpses, they prevent epidemics."
Vesemir, Hrmph. Did he know they eat the living as well?
Geralt," No. Really upset him, too... His theory collapsed."
Vesemir, War's not exactly going our way.
Geralt, We have a side?
Vesemir, The Northern Realms.
Geralt," Radovid's Realms, don't you mean? Temeria and Aedirn are no more."
Vesemir, Radovid's pledged to restore the old borders -- soon as he wins the
Geralt, Believe that?
Vesemir, Hmph. Gotta believe in something. It's what keeps us going.
Vesemir, We going?
Man, Help me! Help!
Man, Ha-has it gone?
Geralt, Yeah. Come out!
Man," Gods, that was close! I was sure I'd end up like my mare."
Vesemir, Provided you got lucky.
Geralt, Your horse died quickly. But griffins like to toy with their prey. Eat
Man," Ahh-ha. You'd...you'd like a reward, I suppose?"
Geralt," You don't owe us anything. You were in need, we helped."
Man, And they call witchers heartless. Say they won't lift a finger without
Geralt, They also say mice are born of rotting straw.
Geralt, Could always use a few crowns.
Man," Thing is, I've a meager purse at the moment. Nilfgaardians requisitioned"
Geralt, Back to the trail?
Vesemir, Like I said -- leads to the main road and ends there. Muddled.
Man, You seek someone?
Geralt," Yes, a woman, medium height, long, black hair. Seen anyone like that?"
Man, No. But...
Geralt, What's it to you?
Man," Well, you see..."
Man, There's an inn here in White Orchard. Sole one around. Gets its share of
Geralt, Not a bad idea. Especially since that wound needs cleaning.
Vesemir," Bah, beast barely grazed me. But sure... Could use a good rye. Nice"
Geralt, Let's go.
Geralt, So...a griffin this close to the village? Strange.
Vesemir," My thoughts exactly. In a forest or mountains, sure, but here? And"
Geralt," Maybe it's the war. Corpses everywhere, stench of blood, burnt flesh..."
Vesemir," Men, too. We need to watch ourselves in White Orchard. And we should"
Villager, Take that down before there's trouble.
Villager," This ain't Temeria no more, old man. It's Nilfgaard now."
Villager, Wha? Witchers...?
Innkeep, Beg your pardon for those thugs.
Vesemir, No need. We're used to it.
Innkeep," Folk're jumpy 'round here. Armies just passed through, now a griffin's"
Geralt, Mhm. Already had the pleasure.
Geralt, One mean beast.
Innkeep," Mean? Light way for a hunter to put it! Clawed Lena so bad,"
Vesemir, With a drop of vodka for me.
Innkeep, And you? Something to wet your tongue?
Geralt," Ran into your kinsman, Bram."
Innkeep, Bram? How is he?
Vesemir, Alive. Sends his regards.
Innkeep, Master witchers...food and drink on the house. What can I
Geralt," Looking for a woman. Raven-haired, violet eyes. Dresses in black and"
Innkeep, I've not seen nor smelt such a lady. Believe I'd remember.
Vesemir, Yeah. Especially hard to forget this one.
Innkeep," Plenty of travelers about, though, folk from all over. Might be worth"
Geralt, Pretty busy place you got.
Innkeep," Nation's on the move. Some search for kin, others just want to get out"
Geralt," So, war's been good for your trade?"
Innkeep," Aye, so far. But it'd be best to know peace again. Times like these"
Geralt, There a contract on the griffin?
Innkeep," Nay, not at the moment. Used to be, soon as a beast'd built a nest"
Vesemir," Shame. We might have done something, but not for free."
Geralt, Thanks. For everything.
Innkeep," Master witchers, would you be of a mind to kill the griffin? Beast's"
Geralt," If someone'll pay us, won't say no."
Geralt, Help you bandage that up?
Vesemir, Please. I'm not decrepit yet.
Geralt, Then I'll ask about Yennefer.
Vesemir, Mhm. Just remember -- we'd rather not draw any attention.
Geralt, I'm looking for someone.
Geralt, Just wanna talk.
Geralt," Running low on patience. Once it's gone, your heads will roll."
Geralt, See a raven-haired woman here? Dressed in black and white?
Geralt, Raven-haired woman dressed in black and white. Seen her?
Geralt, Which way did she go?
Geralt, Uh-huh. And I'll take your tongue if you don't shut up.
Geralt, Waste of words. Don't have time for your kind.
Man, What a waste of time! The earth shall revolve around the sun before you
Geralt, Got a minute?
Aldert," Why not. Aldert Geert, assistant professor in contemporary history at"
Geralt, Geralt of Rivia. Witcher with tenure. I'm looking for a woman -- long
Aldert," Of course not. Unlike this populace, I know the Horsewoman of War is"
Geralt, Horsewoman of War -- what's that about?
Aldert," Folk say an omen, a beautiful phantom rides the fields at night."
Geralt, I can vouch for the last bit. Know where they saw her?
Aldert," No. Facts interest me, not fairytales."
Geralt, Not a place I'd ever expect to find a scholar. Take it you're fleeing
Aldert, Quite the opposite. Chasing it. I'm headed for the front.
Geralt, Tired of life?
Aldert," I seek knowledge, which I value more than life itself. I've a thirst"
Geralt, Take my advice -- go back to your books while you can. War's no
Aldert," Why would he do that? Me, a neutral civilian, a scholar..."
Geralt, Boots.
Aldert, Come again?
Geralt, He'll kill you for your boots.
Geralt, Interesting. We need somebody to describe war -- what it's really
Aldert," Ah, I see you lack the polish of the academy. Rape and cruelty are"
Geralt, Hm. Tell that to the people whose houses burned down.
Geralt, War reached Novigrad yet?
Aldert," No, but it's only a matter of time. Nilfgaard on one bank, Redania on"
Geralt, Many a ruler's choked on that bone.
Aldert, True. We value our liberty in Novigrad and we know how to fight for
Geralt, Mhm. Scholars especially.
Aldert," The sword is not the only weapon. Do not forget, architects from our"
Geralt, Gotta go. So long.
Aldert," A moment, witcher. You strike me as a man of the world. Are you"
Geralt, No. And I don't have time to learn.
Aldert," But the rules are quite simple. Come, let's play."
Geralt, Hmm... Why not.
Aldert, Splendid! Here's how it's done...
Aldert," • Well, well. You have a knack for this game."
Geralt, I'll remember that. Thanks.
Geralt, No thanks. Got some other things on my mind.
Aldert," Shame. I'd ask the locals, but since they can't count to ten,"
Geralt, Looking for a woman.
Dimm," Ahh, like everyone."
Geralt," Not like everyone, and not just any woman. Mine smells of lilac and"
Gaunter, Two schnappses! Hah. It'll lift your spirits.
Geralt," Fine, I'll have a drink."
Geralt, Don't generally drink with strangers.
Gaunter, Come. I know this to be a vile place. You might down a little glass
Geralt, Finding her -- that'll lift my spirits.
Gaunter, You look haggard. It's just a few drops to improve your mood. A
Geralt, Can we cut to the chase? You seen her or not?
Gaunter, Yennefer of Vengerberg?
Geralt, Never mentioned her name.
Gaunter," Yet you described her perfectly. And once I hear something, I never"
Geralt, How do you know Yennefer?
Gaunter," What a question. Master Dandelion's ballads, of course. The only way"
Geralt, And runs into a very patient witcher?
Gaunter, Into Geralt of Rivia himself. The Butcher of Blaviken.
Geralt, You seen Yennefer?
Gaunter," Deepest apologies, but I must ask: Is this about love?"
Geralt, None of your business.
Gaunter," Yes, as a vagrant I deserve no explanation."
Geralt, Guessed it. It's love.
Gaunter, I knew it at once.
Geralt, What do you know? Tell me.
Gaunter," Before you appeared, it never occured to me that might've been"
Geralt, Get to the point.
Gaunter, A Nilfgaardian scout from the local garrison saw her.
Geralt, Where?
Gaunter," At their camp. She rode in -- dark of night, black and white,"
Geralt, Where to?
Gaunter, I'm not omniscient. Ask at the garrison.
Geralt, Thanks.
Geralt," Recognize me from Master Dandelion's ballads, too?"
Gaunter, (drinking) To your health.
Geralt, What do you do? Who are you?
Gaunter," A mangy vagrant. Gaunter O'Dimm, at your service."
Geralt, Vagrant -- that a profession now?
Gaunter," Ah, once a merchant of mirrors. The madding crowd dubbed me Master"
Gaunter, We men of the road must stick together. Perhaps one day I'll be in
Geralt, Mhm.
Geralt, Better round up someone else to help. Three of you don't stand a
Geralt," If I had a bag over my head and my arms tied behind-- Actually, no,"
Geralt," Wouldn't want to stay long, anyway."
Geralt, Haven't done anything to you. So just stay calm.
Geralt, Nice meeting you.
Soldier, Military camp. No locals allowed without the express consent of the
Geralt, I look like a local to you?
Geralt, Dead wrong -- I make trouble go away. I'm a witcher.
Soldier," A witcher...? Captain Peter Saar Gwynleve is in the tower. Turn right,"
Geralt," Huh, you Black Ones aren't so scary after all. Can even be nice when"
Soldier," Don't get accustomed, Nordling."
Geralt, Guessing your captain's got work for me?
Soldier," This is the army, Nordling. There is no guessing."
Peter, How much grain will your village give?
Peasant," Whatever you say, Your Excellency."
Peter, Look at my hands. Look! See the calluses? These are not the hands of an
Peasant," Forty bushels. There'd be more, sir, but our lads, the Temerians, that"
Peter," You will give thirty, and that will do. Let us settle on it. And I wish"
Peasant," Ah, thank you, sir! Thank you kindly!"
Peter," I summoned only the ealdorman and the smith, Willis -- but it is said"
Geralt, Very perceptive of you.
Geralt," Plan to requisition something from him, too?"
Peter," If it is necessary -- yes, of course. We are at war, in case you have"
Geralt, Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Peter, A vatt'ghern -- that explains why I did not hear your footsteps. What
Geralt, Yennefer of Vengerberg. Where was she headed?
Peter, That is a military secret.
Geralt, Haven't thrown me out yet. Haven't called the guards. So go ahead --
Peter," There is a griffin in the area. Slay it, and then I shall see what I"
Geralt, Why do you care about this griffin?
Peter, Because I care about people. The beast has killed ten already. Including
Geralt, Too big a hassle?
Peter, No. Too high a risk. I cannot disperse my forces. Temeria's army we have
Geralt, It's a deal. Some questions first before I start. Know where the
Peter," It kept to the Vulpine Woods at first. I sent a patrol there, five young"
Geralt, Meaning it's abandoned its lair. Gonna have to set a trap.
Peter, I judge from your tone this will not be easy. What do you require?
Geralt," I'll need bait, a specific herb -- buckthorn. Scent should lure the"
Peter, Buck...buckthorn? I do not know this. I am not yet fluent in the
Geralt," Mhm. Probably mastered the basics, though. ""Hands up,"" ""kill them""..."
Peter," No. First came idioms. ""Don't play with fire,"" for example. Go to"
Geralt," Need more information about this griffin. Its sex, why it's abandoned"
Peter, Shall I bring you witnesses?
Geralt, They won't say anything I don't already know. I need to go where
Peter," Mislav. He has a hut south of the village, very near the wood. Helpful"
Geralt, Tomira and Mislav... Thanks.
Peter, (in Nilfgaardian) Good luck to you.
Geralt, Bad time?
Tomira, Not at all. Hand me the beggartick. It's the...
Tomira," ...red bloom. Well, well, one versed in herbs."
Geralt," Probably saying too much...but I know a bit -- for instance, that"
Tomira, In large doses. Small ones soothe pain and bring forth pleasant dreams.
Geralt, Looking for buckthorn. Know if it grows anywhere around here?
Tomira," Mhm. Bottom of the river, where the channel's widest. But you do know"
Geralt, ...it'll stink worse than a week-old carcass? Counting on it.
Tomira," Oh yes, the griffin. Might've guessed. "
Tomira," I was thinkin'... A few years ago, we had trouble, drowners under the"
Geralt, Captain Peter Saar...something something.
Tomira, Ah. Good to know the Black Ones are looking out for our welfare.
Geralt," Doubt Emperor Emhyr cares about you, but his captain just might."
Tomira, there are no decent men in the army. There're only orders.
Geralt, Nilfgaard values one thing -- order. Griffin's
Tomira," Yes. First they'll tend to the monsters, then to the folk."
Geralt," Not from here, are you? Lot of bitterness in you. Too much for"
Tomira," True. And you're in a hurry. Elsewise you'd not use bait, just wait"
Geralt, Believe we could have an interesting conversation.
Tomira, Maybe next time.
Geralt, Griffin do that to her?
Tomira, To Lena? Yes. Attacked her at night. She was walkin' in the woods.
Geralt, At night...through the woods? In wartime?
Tomira," Meeting a boy. The young, you know...do foolish things for love."
Geralt, I've agreed to kill the griffin. No more victims after I do.
Tomira," Ugh, there will be, of course. With the griffin gone, others will"
Geralt, So what do you think I should do?
Tomira, Ply your trade. But don't think you can change anything.
Geralt, Could try to help her with one of my potions. Swallow can
Tomira, But?
Geralt, Witchers' potions aren't for humans.
Tomira, She'll die as it is.
Geralt," Yes. A peaceful death, soothed by your concoctions. If I give her"
Tomira, I understand. Do as you will.
Geralt, Got a potion for Lena. Swallow.
Tomira," First sign of spring, symbol of rebirth... Fitting, as names go."
Geralt," We'll see. Like I said, could harm her. Deeply. Works on me"
Tomira, Why'd you choose this in the end?
Geralt, Decided it was better than doing nothing.
Tomira," I like you, witcher. Here -- a small gift. For giving a damn."
Geralt, Anyone home? Must be out hunting.
Geralt, Trail's fresh. Mislav just left home.
Geralt, You Mislav?
Mislav, Shh. Hear that?
Geralt, Wolves? No -- wild dogs.
Mislav, Yes...more dangerous than wolves.
Geralt, I'm hunting bigger game. The Nilfgaardians the griffin killed --
Mislav," Ah, I see... You a witcher? That monster slayer they's talkin' about"
Geralt, Mhm.
Mislav," I'll show you, sure. But, er, I gotta kill those mutts 'fore they"
Geralt, Sure. Griffin's not going anywhere.
Mislav," No, dogs might, though. So step careful, now. Come on."
Geralt, Blades don't worry me. Time does. I'm in a hurry.
Mislav," Can't fault you for it. Come on, then. I'll show you."
Geralt, Dogs more dangerous than wolves? Don't think so.
Mislav, It's the truth. Know why?
Geralt," No, but I guess you're about to tell me."
Mislav, Wolves hunt to fill their bellies. Wild dogs kill for sport.
Geralt, Just like humans.
Mislav," Aye, they've learned much from us. Why not cruelty, too?"
Geralt, These dogs been a problem for awhile now?
Mislav," Since the war started. Soldier on the march, he'll stop to rape a"
Mislav, Too late. Attacked another one.
Mislav, Dieter...
Geralt, You know him?
Mislav," We served at the lord's manor together, where the black army's encamped"
Geralt, Sorry. Hope you weren't close.
Mislav, No. Not at all.
Geralt, So...can you show me where you found the Nilfgaardians?
Geralt, Before what?
Mislav, Before they drove me from the village.
Geralt, What'd you do?
Mislav," Nothin'. I'm a freak. Sorry, I'd rather not talk about it."
Geralt," Don't have to, then. So...can you show me where you found the"
Geralt," I'm a freak, too."
Mislav," Aye, but of another kind."
Geralt," If it's lycanthropy, I can help."
Mislav, What?
Geralt, Lycanthropy. Werewolves? Handled a few cases in the past. It's
Mislav," The lord's son, Florian, and I... We loved each other. Dieter walked"
Geralt, I'm sorry.
Mislav," Ah, ancient history now. I was to show you where I found"
Geralt, So...can you show me where you found the Nilfgaardians?
Geralt, Griffin -- know anything about it?
Mislav," Oh, not much. It's not my kind of game."
Geralt," You're his kind, though. Survival instincts alone oughta make you care."
Mislav, I walk silent through the woods. No griffin can hear me nor spy me.
Mislav," Twas¹ here. One lay there, by the stump, headless. The other hung from"
Geralt, I'll be fine. Not the first griffin I've dealt with. Not likely to be
Mislav, Hope you're right.
Geralt, Nothing to mourn. They were Nilfgaardians.
Mislav," They were lads, like ours. Just clad in black plate."
Mislav," Good huntin', now."
Geralt, Ground still damp with blood. Griffin attacked the Nilfgaardians here.
Geralt," Griffin's nest. What remains of it, at least."
Geralt, Female. Larvae in her wounds have already hatched. Been dead at least
Geralt, Deep cuts over the whole body. Not a drop of blood on the
Geralt," Beak tip's worn, gray hairs on the coat -- ten, twelve years old."
Geralt," Thick shaft, dense barbs -- a royal griffin."
Geralt, Explains why the male I ran into was so aggressive. Hunted the
Geralt, Done all I could. Should talk to Vesemir.
Vesemir," Good man, whose field is that the other side of the river?"
Peasant," By the wood? Boyan Klimmek's. Good lad, master witcher, though he..."
Vesemir," Yes, yes. This Boyan, will he venture out to inspect his grain any"
Peasant, What for? Harvest is a long way off yet.
Geralt, Got good news and bad news. Good news first -- captain of the
Vesemir, And the bad's that we have to kill the griffin for him. What else
Geralt," Griffin's abandoned its lair. Gotta make a lure, set a trap."
Vesemir, And how's that going?
Geralt, Been busy with the griffin contract.
Vesemir, And?
Geralt," Learned some things. It's a male, had its nest in the Vulpine Woods."
Vesemir," Hm. It's always the same. Instead of sending out for a professional,"
Geralt, Got the buckthorn.
Vesemir, Oughta work like a charm. Powerful scent.
Geralt, More like stench.
Vesemir," City boy. Rotting meat, manure, piss -- standard smells of the"
Geralt, How can I forget? You ever gonna stop bringing that up?
Vesemir," Alright, about the griffin -- learn what you can. We gotta"
Vesemir," Hm-hm. Fine, if everything's ready, say the word and we'll get to"
Geralt, I'm ready. No point in waiting. Let's find a good spot to ambush it.
Vesemir, Picked one out already. Other side of the stream -- there's fields and
Geralt, Good. Meet you there.
Geralt," A stream, amber waves of grain...charming place. Perfect for an ambush."
Vesemir," I know how to choose 'em. So, ready?"
Geralt," Let's start. Wind's good, bait's scent will spread quickly."
Geralt, I need a minute.
Vesemir," Ehh, drag a man outta the tavern, and then... Fine, but hurry."
Vesemir, Now all we have to do is wait. Come on. We can cower in the shade of
Geralt," So, tell me...once we find Yennefer, what'll you do? Got your eye on a"
Vesemir, No. I'll go to Kaer Morhen.
Geralt, A little early to settle in for the winter.
Vesemir," Snows are a way off, yes...and that's what worries me. Nilfgaard's"
Geralt, Maybe. Might bring a guest.
Vesemir, Hear that? It's close.
Geralt, Let's go give it a warm welcome.
Vesemir, Wait. Take this.
Geralt, A crossbow?
Vesemir, Won it in a card game while you ran around. Might come in handy.
Geralt, A witcher with a crossbow? We breaking with tradition?
Geralt," How about that. Always lectured us on the evils, but you're a"
Vesemir, Stop talking. Got a griffin to kill.
Vesemir," Watch out! Damn, it's fast! It's about to dive!"
Vesemir, Don't let it get away!
Vesemir," Not bad, not bad. Though you could stand to improve a some things."
Geralt, Man spends his whole life learning.
Vesemir, Not a witcher. Unless he doesn't want to live long.
Geralt, For example?
Vesemir, Upward vertical strike -- it's too obvious.
Vesemir, But more on that later. Take the griffin's head to the Black Ones.
Peter, What the hell is this?
Peasant, R-rye.
Peter, You take me for a blind man or a fool? This grain is rotten.
Peasant, I--...I didn't know.
Peter," So, a fool. Dammit, you never learn... Military codex, article two,"
three," ""For the delivery of defective goods -- fifteen lashes"
Peasant," No, no, no! By the gods, no!"
Peter, What?
Geralt, Fulfilled my end of the bargain. Your turn. Where'd Yennefer go?
Peter, To Vizima.
Geralt," She was a day's ride from here the whole time, right under my nose?"
Peter," Yes, I might have. But you would not have killed the griffin. Tit for"
Geralt, Guess you've dropped your good uncle act.
Peter, It was no act. I extended a hand to these people. They spat on it.
Geralt, Could it be 'cause it held the sword that killed their loved ones?
Peter, Hah! A moralist! And what would you do in my stead?
Geralt, Wouldn't ever be in your stead.
Peter, Tell me why you've come.
Peter," Halt! We are not done. It's yours, this gold. I would not want you to"
Geralt," Yennefer's in Vizima. Got a few friends there, so... Something wrong?"
Vesemir, Look around. Trouble brewing.
Geralt, Time we were on our way.
Vesemir, Mhm.
Geralt, Who are they?
Vesemir," Patriots. Drinking their seventh round for Temeria, fists starting"
Geralt, Don't see any Nilfgaardians.
Vesemir, They'll find another foe.
Vesemir," I'll buy some provisions for the journey. Then we'll go. Geralt, we"
Woman, What happened to the Lilies?
Elsa, Took 'em down.
Woman, Took 'em down? To hang a golden sun there now?
Elsa, I cannot show Temerian colors. They'll come and burn the tavern down.
Woman, Maybe it's true what they say. You fond of the Imperials? You
Elsa, I'll let that pass. I know grief eats at your heart.
Woman, You know shit. They hanged my sister -- dragged her out o' the cloister
Elsa, Let go!
Woman," You don't fear it, you cunt?!"
Woman, Leave me be!
Vesemir, Recognize this medallion. You know what it means. Back off.
Geralt, You all right?
Patriot, They say witchers steal young'uns! 
Vesemir," Get out, all of you."
Patriot, We ain't goin' nowhere. And neither are you.
Vesemir, They won't back down now.
Geralt, I can see that.
Geralt, It's all right. It's over.
Woman, Leave me be! Get away!
Man, See his face? Gods save us!
Innkeep, Begone. And don't ever come back.
Vesemir, So much for not getting involved. Come on. Let's go.
Geralt, That brawl? We didn't start it.
Yennefer," Excuses, excuses... You've not changed a bit."
Geralt, Ye...Yen? How?
Yennefer, I received a report. About a witcher who'd appeared in White Orchard.
Geralt," Sorry... Wasn't expecting to see you. To be honest, this isn't at all"
Yennefer, How did you imagine it?
Vesemir, He didn't imagine you'd have a Nilfgaardian escort. Don't get me
Yennefer, And I shall provide it...in Vizima. Ready your horses.
Geralt," We can talk here. Some charming orchards nearby. In bloom, even, so"
Yennefer," A tempting proposition. Sadly, I must say no. You see, someone"
Geralt, Spent the last six months in the saddle. Haven't seen you for two
Yennefer," Sadly, we cannot. Someone awaits you, Geralt. Someone who doesn't"
Yennefer," Emperor Emhyr var Emreis...or, to those on more intimate terms with"
Geralt," Doubt I number among that group. Far as I remember, last time we saw"
Yennefer," Well, now he wishes to make you an offer."
Vesemir, The kind one can't refuse?
Yennefer, I didn't. Though I could have.
Geralt, Fine. Guess I'm willing to hear him out.
Yennefer," The emperor of Nilfgaard, Lord of Metinna, Ebbing and Gemmara,"
Geralt," Must've been a damn good offer, then. Not many things you'd give up"
Yennefer," The sooner we set off, the sooner you'll find out."
Geralt, What about you?
Vesemir, I'm going in the opposite direction. I somehow doubt the emperor's
Geralt," Yeah, I remember. Thanks for your help, Vesemir. See you soon."
Yennefer, How's your horse? Swift?
Geralt, Can't complain. Why do you ask?
Yennefer, I'd like to be back behind some thick city walls. As soon as
Geralt, You know...had a dream about you recently.
Yennefer," Knowing you, it was probably filthy."
Geralt, Just the beginning. But then--
Yennefer, But then?
Yennefer, Ride! Now!
Soldier, (in Nilfgaardian) Watch out!
Geralt," Yennefer, how'd they--"
Yennefer," We shall talk of this tomorrow, all right? After the audience."
Man, Hmm. It must suffice.
Geralt, Think Emhyr cares if I'm clean?
Man, The gentleman will refer to His Imperial Majesty by his full title or not
Geralt, The what now?
Man, In that...chair.
Man, Cledwyn. Please shave the gentleman -- sideburns to half an inch.
Geralt, What's wrong with my beard? Always thought it added to my dignity.
Man, It does. Yet it also detracts from your elegance. In Nilfgaard we
Geralt," Been on the road awhile. Fine, do your thing."
Geralt," Fine...then what? Gonna do my nails, too?"
Man," If time permits. Sadly, the day is short, while the list of hygienic"
Cledwyn," Tilt your head back, please. And sit still."
Man," Yes, general. The gentleman will be more or less presentable."
Geralt," Who's this guy? He a barber, too?"
Morvran, No. Morvran Voorhis. Commander of the Alba Division. Yennefer's escort
Geralt, Your men died in battle. As soldiers tend to.
Morvran, I see their fate does not trouble you...overly.
Geralt, True. But I'm guessing the fate of those whose country they invaded
Geralt, Wild Hunt killed them.
Morvran, A cavalcade of wraiths dashing across the night sky? These omens of
Geralt," Frankly, I don't really give a damn."
Morvran," Nordlings -- ugh. We can bathe you, shave you and clothe you, but"
Geralt," Nice meeting you, too."
Cledwyn," Done. Shall I shave him once more, against the grain?"
Morvran, No. He himself is very much against the grain -- that's enough.
Man, Good. Now the gentleman may dress.
Man," General, I am not certain this is the appropriate time."
Morvran," Morvran Voorhis, commander of the Alba Division. Before they take you"
Geralt, Sure. Paperwork's gotta be in order.
Morvran," So, Geralt of Rivia. Place of birth -- unknown, parents -- unknown,"
Geralt, Foltest ordered me to clear the path. The boy stood in my way.
Morvran, Cutting down the La Valette heir -- this made no impression on you?
Geralt," We fought on opposing sides, true. Then we landed in the same"
Morvran," Ahh, so that is how the blaze started. Our reports suggested the"
Morvran," Moving on. You found shelter in charming Flotsam, and from there made"
Geralt," I got outta Flotsam with Vernon Roche, commander of the Blue Stripes"
Morvran," ...A murderer of nonhumans. We know this gentleman well, witcher."
Geralt," I left Flotsam with Iorveth, commander of a Scoia'tael unit."
Morvran, A slayer of monsters and a slayer of men...
Morvran, You forge interesting alliances.
Geralt," Something tells me my most interesting is yet to come. Go on, next"
Morvran, We shall shave you again if it does. Very well. The infamous summit
Geralt, The mighty had imprisoned Triss Merigold. Oughta know I care about
Morvran," And so you did, handing Radovid control of the Conclave and Council"
Geralt, Not the way I see it. I helped a friend rescue a child.
Morvran, Anaïs was not just any child. She was a pawn in a game you did not
Geralt, Not at all. I meddled in a personal affair. Helped Iorveth lift a
Morvran," Yes, and in doing so gave Radovid a reason to begin his witch hunts."
Geralt, Nilfgaard recently started a war. Unprovoked. So do us both a favor
Cledwyn, The gentleman must sit still. I am almost done.
Morvran," I'm afraid I might find that difficult. Because from what I know,"
Geralt," I watched her get in the megascope, but ultimately freed her...from"
Geralt," Huh, an old acquaintance, more like. Not so close that I felt bad"
Morvran," ""He believes he alone knows what is good and what is evil, and that"
Geralt, My comrade -- your agent.
Morvran," Well, national interest calls on one to forge difficult alliances at"
Geralt," Well, that alliance has been dissolved. Irrevocably. I killed Letho"
Morvran, So we heard. And it's a good thing you did. Saved our agents some
Geralt, That an ongoing alliance? What's Letho up to?
Morvran, I had hoped you would answer that question.
Geralt, Ah. So Letho's hiding from you. Must have a good reason. Was there a
Morvran," I believe that is all. Your signature, please, affirming you stated"
Man," With these formalities seen to, I would ask the general to leave the room."
Morvran," Shame... I might've given you some advice. So long, Geralt. Good luck"
Man," Good. Now the gentleman may dress. Sadly, I did not receive exact"
Geralt, Feels more like I'm being readied for a wedding.
Man," Were that so, I would have prepared the gentleman a frock, a tailcoat,"
Geralt," Black, black...or black."
Man, We do not like garish colors in Nilfgaard.
Geralt, Where're my clothes?
Man, Where they should have gone long ago. With the laundress. They will be
Man, The gentleman will tell me once he has chosen an outfit.
Man, • Black suits the gentleman.
Geralt, A studded doublet and a sword on my back -- that's what would satisfy
Man, Yes...?
Geralt, It's a saying. So what now? Powder my nose?
Man, No need. The gentleman's complexion is light enough.
Geralt, Rather try on something else.
Man," Go ahead, we've time."
Man, The gentleman is to stand before the Ruler of the North and South. I must
Geralt, Confirm away.
Man," Please watch. Leg extended, hand flat, head down, chin to chest."
Man," Wrong, wrong, wrong. Once more. {previous demonstration repeats}"
Man," Hmm, lacking fluidity and grace. But we've learned to expect less"
Man," Please, this is neither the time nor the place for such antics."
Geralt, Gotta be kidding.
Man, Not at all. I am mortally serious. Does the gentleman know the
Geralt, I'm not some boor. I know how to bow.
Man," Please, demonstrate."
Man," That, sir, is how you might bow to a whore on the street corner, not to"
Man, The gentleman will address the emperor only when asked to and using the
Geralt, Your Archmagnificency?
Man, I see the gentleman is in the mood for jests. I fear the emperor might not
Man," (in Nilfgaardian) Bow before his Imperial Majesty, The White Flame Dancing"
Geralt, Your Imperial Majesty.
Man, (in Nilfgaardian) As your Majesty wished...
Emhyr, (in Nilfgaardian) All except the witcher will leave.
Geralt, You're Imperial Majesty.
Man, (in Nilfgaardian) As your Majesty wished...
Emhyr, (in Nilfgaardian) All except the witcher will leave.
Emhyr, • I thought you bowed before no man.
Geralt, Didn't want to disappoint the chamberlain. We're friends.
Geralt, Know what they say -- can't teach an old wolf new tricks?
Geralt," Take it you didn't summon me to reminisce about the good old days,"
Emhyr," Silence. My daughter Cirilla...she's returned, and she's in danger. The"
Geralt, How many men in your army? Twenty thousand? Thirty? So why me?
Emhyr, You know why. Because she trusts you.
Geralt," She trusts me, yes. So tell me why you're looking for her. Doubt it's"
Emhyr, For reasons of state. As always. Enough of this banter. You will agree
Geralt," I need information, not motivation. Ciri...leaves few tracks. She'll"
Emhyr," My corps of spies will help you. Count on them, and my army, should"
Geralt, Save your generosity for those whose houses your armies have razed.
Emhyr, Your motives do not interest me. Only results.
Geralt," Are you sure? Ciri...left. Went far, far away."
Emhyr, Do you believe I'd drag you here in the middle of a war to discuss a
Geralt," I think anyone can be wrong, even an emperor."
Emhyr, I had forgotten how insolent you can be. I haven't the time to
Emhyr, Yennefer will tell you the rest. This audience is finished. Mererid!
Emhyr, Take him to the sorceress.
Mererid," • Follow me, if the gentleman pleases. Please keep close. There are"
Geralt, ...disgusts?
Mererid, ...need not bother.
Geralt, Relax. Nothing happened.
Mererid, To the gentleman. But I shall be punished.
Geralt, How?
Mererid, Please keep close and bother no one. We've had enough
Morvran, (in Nilfgaardian) These days it's unwise for small realms to remain
Geralt, Mind if I interrupt?
Morvran, Why not join in instead?
Man, We're discussing neutrality. How difficult it is to preserve.
Geralt, Know a thing or two about that.
Morvran, Care to explain?
Geralt," Never changes. I try to stay out of things, stand aside...then"
Geralt, Still worth trying.
Morvran, Because?
Geralt, Because there are few causes worth serving. Even fewer men.
Geralt, Enough about that. Mind if we change the subject?
Geralt," So, talked to the emperor."
Morvran, Hm. Why did he summon you?
Geralt, So not even you know.
Morvran, No. But I wager it's an ordinary witchers' contract.
Geralt, Mhm. Some werebbubbs.
Geralt, See you.
Morvran," Soon, mind you."
Mererid, The gentleman will have time for a stroll later. Please stay with me.
Mererid," Once the gentleman is done, he should see me to retrieve his"
Yennefer, Geralt! That tunic -- you look positively smashing.
Geralt," Ugh, dying to take it off."
Yennefer, I'd consider that a proposition under different circumstances...one
Geralt," Mhm. And seems we're in the same boat, now. Ciri -- she's really back?"
Yennefer," Look -- that's more or less what she looks like now, or so our agents"
Geralt," Hm, so they're ""our"" agents now? My, my...you've clearly settled in"
Yennefer," Geralt, don't twist my words. I know who Emhyr. He started this war"
Geralt, How about that...she's grown up.
Yennefer, It's been years since you trained together at Kaer Morhen. A great
Geralt, You haven't. Not a bit.
Yennefer, I missed those awkward compliments of yours... But let's focus on
Geralt, Right. Emhyr said the Wild Hunt's after her. I'd find that hard to
Yennefer, Because of me. You see...I've spent months searching for Ciri. Using
Geralt," Well, guess you were wrong."
Yennefer," Hm. I've sensed them on my trail, hunting me, for some time. If not"
Geralt," So where's Ciri been seen, exactly?"
Yennefer, In two places -- Velen and Novigrad. The trail in Velen is most

Yennefer," None. Sorry to spoil your fun, your boyhood fantasies about the"
Geralt, Sure she'll be delighted to see me. What about you? What will you do?
Yennefer, I shall sail for Skellige. There was a magic explosion there
Geralt, One thing before we go... Why didn't you contact me? Didn't
Yennefer, I didn't want to spoil things. I'd heard you and Triss
Geralt, Yen...I'd lost my memory.
Yennefer," Really -- that's your excuse? Let's drop it, all right?"
Geralt, The Wild Hunt -- what could it want from Ciri?
Yennefer," I've no clue, Geralt. Might've written them to ask, but I don't"
Geralt," Guess this means we need to split up again. Not my preference, but I"
Yennefer," It is indeed. So, why don't I teleport you to Velen, get you there"
Geralt, Not gonna happen. I'll go on horseback. Soon as I can get changed.
Yennefer," Have it your way. Oh, and...you really look quite dashing in black"
Geralt, Think so? Maybe I can have some of my armor lined with it. Hm. Good
Yennefer, Same to you. And if you wish to learn what's happened in the world
Yennefer, I shall be waiting.
Geralt, Ambassador var Attre? Yennefer suggested I ask you about current
Attre, Of course. The emperor's servants keep no secrets from each other.
Geralt," How's the war going? I mean, apart from the fact that Nilfgaard's"
Geralt, Radovid? Submit?
Geralt, That admiration I hear in your voice?
Geralt, What about Kovir?
Geralt, Couldn't you just go home? Save everyone a lot of marching. Not to
Geralt, Hm. How do things look in Velen?
Geralt, Mhm. So how's ruling that earthly paradise going for you?
Geralt, Any news from Novigrad? Is the free city still free?
Geralt, Meaning?
Geralt, What's new in Skellige?
Geralt, Sound awfully confident. What if King Bran manages to unite the
Geralt, Thanks for your help.
Mererid, How might I serve the gentleman?
Geralt, By returning my things.
Mererid, Citrus and cloves. The fragrance will keep the gentleman's robes fresh
Geralt, Mhm. Thanks bunches.
Mererid," The Emperor is not known for his patience. He wants his daughter back,"
Geralt," Yeah, mentioned something of the sort. So long."
Geralt, Looking for a man. Goes by the name Hendrik.
Innkeep, What you want with 'im?
Geralt, Wanna talk to him.
Innkeep, What about?
Geralt, Gimme a bottle of something strong.
Innkeep, You gotta go! I'll open the back way for ye!
Geralt, Haven't finished my drink yet.
Geralt, Got company. Who is it?
Man, Innkeep! Vodka!
Man," Oi, gray boy! What's the point of havin' two swords?"
Man," You fuckin' deaf? Gonna say who you are, or do I need to loosen your"
Geralt, Someone who'd prefer not to be bothered while he's having a drink.
Man, Heh! Hear that? We've a distinguished gentleman in our midst!
Geralt, No. Wouldn't want the grime on your hands to rub off on them.
Man, Bolo...did you hear what I heard?
Geralt, Go away. Or I'll kill you.
Man, Dammit. Enough!
Geralt," I'm a witcher. Heard you wondering about my swords. Well, one's for"
Man," Don't touch 'im. Don't even look at 'im. Worse than lepers, that lot."
Man, Got the stench o' corpses on 'im.
Geralt, How about I buy everybody a round?
Geralt," Got the coin for it, simple as that."
Man, I don't drink with strangers.
Geralt," We share a round, won't be strangers anymore. Then we go our separate"
Man, And which way might yours be?
Geralt," Is it just me, or is that none of your fucking business?"
Man, I must be hearing things.
Man," I'll have to kill 'im, then."
Geralt, On my way to Novigrad.
Man, City of whores and whoremongers.
Geralt, Who are you?
Man," Oh, aye -- an' why do you care?"
Geralt, Like to know who I'm drinking with -- just like you.
Man, We're the baron's men. And you're in his land.
Geralt, A baron holds these lands? Must be quite a man -- doesn't care a
Geralt, This is interesting stuff.
Man, Our baron's baron 'cause that's the way we want it. And if that
Geralt, Just curious. Wondering what you're doing here.
Man, I don't like curious types.
Geralt, Really. How badly?
Man, So bad that I kill 'em.
Geralt, To your health. And mine.
Man, Bottoms up.
Innkeep," If you wanna rest, come with me. I've a bench you can use."
Innkeep, Thanks for not startin' a row with those swine.
Geralt, I don't generally poke my nose into other people's business.
Innkeep, Lookin' to stay the night?
Geralt, No.
Innkeep, Ahh...
Geralt, I'm looking for Hendrik.
Innkeep, Have you any idea what the Baron'll do when he learns of this
Geralt, Where's Hendrik?
Innkeep, You deaf?! Y'understand what I'm sayin'? Baron won't let this stand!
Geralt, Calm down. Your baron's no idiot. Seriously doubt he'll think you
Innkeep, Man lives in Heatherton.
Geralt, Don't know where that is.
Innkeep, Other side of the hill. Looked thataway this morn and saw a strange
Geralt, Anything else you can tell me about Hendrik?
Innkeep, Odd fellow. Arrived from who knows where for no apparent reason.
Geralt, Baron's men don't like strangers.
Innkeep," Aye, an' he stays out o' their way. Always seems to know when"
Geralt," Thanks, innkeep."
Innkeep, Go out the back. More o' the baron's men in the village.
Geralt, No need to worry about me.
Innkeep," I'd rather you not make any more trouble -- for yourself, or us"
Geralt, Air is strange... Like dropping into a deep cellar on a hot day... And
Man," Begone! Leave me be, whoever you is! Get away!"
Geralt, Calm down. It's over.
Man," Aye, it's over... All's past, never to be restored. I'll not forget that"
Geralt, What happened?
Man, I dunno... I don't wanna know. They came for Hendrik...and they got 'im.
Geralt, Looking for a man named Hendrik. Supposed to live in his village.
Man," Aye, he did. No longer. They nabbed 'im in that hut. If you'd o' heard"
Geralt, Tell me what happened here. Step by step.
Man, They took 'em... Took 'em all...
Geralt, Farewell. And peace of mind to you.
Man, Hm. Mm hm hm...
Man," The sun was waning, see...and the dusk went crimson like blood. Thought to"
Geralt, Dammit!
Man," Weren't here long, the terrors. Yet the village froze like the heart of"
Geralt, You in that hut when they rode off?
Man, No. And I'll not set foot there. Never.
Geralt, • Great.
Geralt," Face scorched, hard to identify."
Geralt, Tortured him. Maybe they missed something.
Geralt, There's a draft... Gotta be a space under this rubble. Guess I should

Geralt," Powerful aura -- must be some artifact, or..."
Geralt, So this is where she disappeared to.
Geralt," Well, well. Nice."
Keira," I was wondering how long it would take you, Geralt. I'm upstairs. Don't"
Geralt, Missed a spot.
Keira, Where? Hope you didn't come to gawk.
Geralt, No. To talk.
Keira, Turn around and wait.

Geralt, I'm looking for a certain young woman.
Keira, Oh really. Who?
Geralt, I'm looking for Ciri. That Ciri. And no one can know. Understand?
Keira, Cirilla is here? The girl once sought by the Lodge of Sorceresses and
Geralt, Indications are she's hiding from someone. I heard she quarreled
Geralt," Apparently, she quarreled with a local witch."
Keira, Pff. Someone's been feeding you horseshit. The girls around here are
Geralt, She's not from here.
Keira," You're up to something, Geralt. If I'm to help you, you must tell me"
Geralt, Ciri.
Keira," Ciri? Well...now I understand the secrecy, not to mention the"
Geralt, So you haven't seen her.
Geralt," So, betcha saw this question coming: what are you doing here?"

Keira," Yes, that's exactly what I mean -- Radovid's new pastime, pursuing"
Geralt, Changing the subject...

Keira, Radovid and Emhyr are different in every respect except one. They

Keira, Huh. Horrid.
Geralt, No joy in having the boundless respect and trust of the local
Keira, They'd respect anyone who could produce hemorrhoid cream.

Keira, Long enough for rot to set in. You cannot possibly imagine how much I

Keira, None. We can't know too much about one another these days. It's safer

Geralt," See you, Keira."
Keira, I'm certain I haven't. But recently someone asked me about an

Geralt, He say anything else about her?
Keira," Not so fast, Geralt. No humble plea? No offering for the witch?"
Geralt," What's your rate these days? A couple dozen eggs? Three hens, maybe?"
Keira, My rate rises with every word you speak. I'm not sure you can afford
Geralt," Hm, you're pricklier than I remember. Isn't living in nature's lap"
Keira, Nature stinks.

Keira," Well, I tried to ask him, of course, about everything..."
Geralt, Of course.
Keira, But you know how elves are -- he asked many more questions than he
Geralt, He leave any message for her?
Keira," No, but he asked were I to meet her, to lead her to him."
Geralt, So you know where to find him?
Keira," Yes, he said he'd found a hideout in some elven ruins near the village"
Keira, I'll go there with you.
Geralt, Why? Think I'll have trouble finding this place?
Keira," I've unfinished business with this elf. He promised me something, but"
Geralt," Let's go, then."
Keira," Yes, let's."
Geralt, Can't go just yet.
Keira, In that case we'll meet there. I'll await you near the cave entrance.
QUEST, IN CIRI'S FOOTSTEPS (VELEN) |_
Keira, This is the place.
Geralt, Been here before?
Keira," No. I was hoping the elf would return as he'd promised, or else his"
Geralt," Well, let's find out."
Keira, There you are...at last.
Geralt, Can we go? I'd like to finally meet this mysterious elf.
Keira, I do wonder if the two of you will hit it off.
Geralt, Not like I wanna bed him. Just want to ask him about Ciri.
Keira," Come on! Gvella, glan!"
Geralt, The Wild Hunt.
Keira, What?! Phantom riders? That means...I thought they didn't exist!
Geralt," Feast your eyes on the nonexistent, then."
Geralt, Hm. Got a navigator with them.
Keira, A what?
Geralt, Can you teleport us to the other side?
Keira, I'd rather teleport us home. Do you really mean to follow them?
Geralt, Teleport. Hurry up!
Keira, Not sure I like any of this. Ready. Follow me! Aaaaargh!
Geralt, Damn portals. Wonder where Keira is now.
Geralt, Keira?
Keira, • Aargh!
Keira," Geralt, do something! They're crawling out of those holes...! Use a"
Geralt, Stay calm. They're only rats.
Keira, I hate...! Uggggh! I hate rats!
Keira," Whew, thank you."
Geralt, You that afraid of rats? Could've annihilated them with one spell.
Geralt," Fine, won't say anything... So, what happened to you?"
Keira," There's something here, something that distorts teleportation. I've no"
Geralt, Wild Hunt's teleportation magic is different. Got specially trained
Keira, They can have three helmsmen and a parrot for all I care. I'll not risk
Geralt," Let's go. Wild Hunt got a good head start on us, but we still stand a"
Keira, Have you gone completely mad? We must leave here at once!
Geralt, Let's go. We might still reach the elven mage before they do.
Keira, But what does the Hunt want from him?
Geralt, If that elf has information about Ciri... Or if she tried to find
Keira," Very well. Let's move on. Perhaps we'll come across some clue, some"
Geralt," If you're scared, turn back. I'm gonna go on."
Keira, Stop it! That's emotional blackmail!
Geralt, You'd really worry about me if I went on alone?
Keira, You?! I'd be concerned for myself!
Geralt," Then come with me. Just...quick decision, c'mon."
Keira," Very well, have it your way. How did I ever let you talk me into"
Geralt, I gotta know what the Wild Hunt's doing here.
Keira," But we came to find the elven mage, not fight the Hunt!"
Geralt," If they reach him first, we won't get a chance to talk to him."
Keira," Go on, finish. Wait, you've some special interest in the Hunt... Is"
Geralt, Come with me and maybe I will.
Keira, Are you always like this? I'm beginning to feel sorry for Triss and
Keira," Gvella, glan!"
Elf," (in elvish) Daughter of the Gull. Greetings. I await you, Daughter of the"
Keira, That's him! That's the elf!
Elf, (in elvish) Follow the sign of your sword.
Geralt, What was that? An illusion?
Keira, No... A morphotic projection.
Geralt," Message was definitely for Ciri. ""Daughter of the Gull"" -- Lara"
Keira," Indeed, it is what the elves would title Ciri. But what was the bit"
Geralt," Yeah, not a hard one, though. Not if you know Ciri named her sword"
Keira," Come now, who aside from you would know that?"
Geralt," Might've been the point. Your elven mage secured the passage, hid it,"
Keira, He failed to foresee that someone like you would show up.
Geralt," Nevertheless, I think he was expecting uninvited guests, made some"
Keira," Well then, let's go. Do you think following the swallows will suffice?"
Geralt, We'll see.
Geralt, A what projection?
Keira, Something akin to a postbox for mages. Much safer than an ordinary
Keira, An old elven...port?
Geralt, Must've been how they got here by sea.
Keira, I wonder how long ago that was...
Geralt, Careful! That oily yellow vapor -- it's toxic.
Keira, I hardly need instruction from you. I recognized the vulpine morel
Geralt," Vesemir told me that soon after he'd learned to cast Igni, he tried it"
Keira, Terrible idea. What happened?
Geralt," Well, he survived. And wounds heal awfully quickly on young witchers."
Keira, How's the water?
Geralt, Refreshing. Don't know what you're missing.
Keira, A swallow. Seems we're headed the right way.
Keira, Look. It's rather similar to that other pillar with the projection...
Elf," (in elvish) Swallow, the obvious route is not always the best. Find"
Keira, Kelpie? Does he mean that sea monster?
Geralt, No. That's what Ciri named her mare. Horse could apparently gallop
Keira," Hm, good name for a horse. So, shall we look for it? Gvella, glan!"
Keira, I wonder what all this means. They look hastily scribbled on with lime.
Geralt, Hunting dog. Can't see any connection to Kelpie.
Keira," Must you touch everything? Geralt, are you all right?"
Geralt, You might say so.
Geralt, A sea monster. Looks a bit like a kayran.
Keira," Geralt, what the hell is that?!"
Geralt, Another security measure. Dammit all...
Keira," Do you think it's a mind game or something? You know, can you defeat"
Geralt," Sorry, I just don't share your doubts. Know exactly which one of you's"
Keira, Oof... Anything like that ever happen to you before?
Geralt," Weeell, almost. While back a certain doppler took a shot at"
Keira, Yes? And?
Geralt, He hated being me. Felt uncomfortable. Dopplers're kind-hearted by
Geralt," Drawing of a horse. Clue for Ciri, must be."
Geralt, Kelpie... Another horse. Almost exactly like the last one. Let's see
Keira," Geralt? I don't know what you did, but it worked! Come back here! Look,"
Keira, Let's go.
Keira," Well, now I know what distorted my effort at teleportation. This very"
Geralt, And I know why I landed in that drowner nest.
Keira, You should be pleased you emerged from the portal in one piece.
Geralt, And everyone still wonders why I hate to be teleported.
Keira, We must try to activate it.
Geralt, Think that's a...swallow.
Keira, It worked. Come.
Geralt, Sure it's safe?
Keira," Of course. The elven mage prepared this passage for Ciri. Come on, now."
Keira, It's grown awfully quiet.
Geralt, Is that bad?
Keira, A bit like the calm before a storm...
Keira, I've a bad feeling about this.
Golem, Zireael not recognized. Intruders. Destroy the intruders.
Keira, And that would be that! I knew we'd manage.
Geralt, That so? Make sure and tell me beforehand next time.
Keira," My intuition's a fine instrument, witcher. Don't underestimate it. I've"
Keira," Once you finally find Ciri, what will you do? Any plans?"
Geralt, Depends what she wants.
Keira, Imagined it -- how it will...transpire? What will she say? What will she
Geralt, No.
Keira, I'm sorry. For getting ahead of myself. At times I forget...we hardly
Geralt, Not to worry. We'll get there.
Keira, Uh-oh.
Keira, And more...
Keira," Look, they're opening! Let's go."
Geralt, Teleport over there.
Keira, We must activate it quickly. I've a feeling another golem's about to
Geralt, Another swallow...
Keira," Look, it worked. Come on."
Keira," Look, we managed to cross the bridge. This is where we saw the Wild"
Geralt, Great. Means they're way ahead of us. Come on.
Geralt, Wild Hunt -- definitely.
Keira, They destroyed the mage's sentries? They didn't come here for a friendly
Geralt, Meaning you ever thought they might've?
Geralt, Frozen 'em before they could attack.
Mage, Shaar'az!
Soldier, (in Elvish) They're here already.
Mage, (in Elvish) Tend to them. We've no time to lose. Go.
Navigator, Shaent tah'vir!
Keira, What is this?!
Geralt, The White Frost! Mage from the Hunt summoned it! Can you seal those
Keira, They're too far! We must get closer! I shall shield us with Demetia
Keira, Ready! Stay close! Bhain'ne calar! We must close them...!
Geralt, Want me to go...?!
Keira," I'll do it, just cover me! An Gal Scam'Hanach!"
Keira," Whew, I'm beginning to think we might make it. Bhain'ne calar! An Gal"
Geralt, Just one more.
Keira, Mhm. Bhain'ne calar! An Gal Scam'Hanach!
Keira, It worked... Da'arian annoi!
Geralt, Keira! What's wrong?
Keira, It'll pass... That took...a great deal of Power.
Geralt, Just don't faint on me.
Keira," Now, in your firm embrace? Not on your life."
Geralt, If you can't go on...
Keira, You can't leave me here!
Geralt, I'd never do that. Ahem. Love to be able to say we could stay awhile
Keira," I know, I know. We must go on."
Geralt," Hm, they blocked the passage. Maybe I can try--"
Keira, Leave it to me.
Keira," Gvella, glan! Come. We might still catch them."
Geralt, Thanks for your help. Pretty tough slog.
Keira," Good thing I came with you. You'd never have managed without me, would"
Geralt, Yeah. Never.
Keira, He awaits us...
Elf," You are stubborn, dh'oine."
Keira," Geralt, I shall help you--"
Geralt, Step back.
Keira, Stop telling me what to do!
Nithral, Salah vatt'ghern!
Keira," Geralt, look! He's opening a passage!"
Geralt, Stay calm. Focus.
Nithral, Salah vatt'ghern!
Keira, Geralt! Another rift!
Keira, Are you well and whole? I feared--
Geralt, Unnecessarily. Let's look around.
Keira," If I've my knickers on straight, this looks like the elf's laboratory."
Keira," Look, the elf left another message for Ciri."
Elf, (in Elvish) Daughter of the Gull.
Geralt," All right, let's watch this message."
Elf," Zireael, this place is no longer safe. Do not tarry here long. Trust no"
Geralt," ""Where last we were together."" Not much to go on. Dammit!"
Keira, Perhaps it's best he didn't leave a clearer message. The Wild Hunt broke
Geralt," They searched everything...and if they had more time, they'd probably"
Keira," Well, we know they were well acquainted, and traveling together."
Geralt, The Witches of Crookback Swamp...
Keira, Crookback Bog.
Geralt, Keira! If you're hiding something...
Keira, But -- I didn't say...
Geralt, You know these witches?
Keira," I've never met them, but I've read of them. In an old manuscript I"
Geralt, Hm. What's your take on all this?
Keira," I'd love to shrug it off as the nattering of so many old women,"
Geralt, Why didn't you say anything earlier? I told you Ciri had a run in¹
Keira," I had no idea you meant them... If I'd told you something, you would"
Geralt," Now, after I safely lead you through the cave?"
Keira, I can't believe you'd think so poorly of me. Perhaps you do bear a
Geralt, Mhm. Can't imagine where that comes from.
Geralt, Wonder why they split up.
Keira," Perhaps because the Wild Hunt was on the elf's trail, and Ciri would"
Geralt, How do I find them?
Keira," The swamps are vast, dangerous, but they say the Crones mark the way"
Geralt, Treats?
Keira," Of course, they didn't read you bedtime stories at Kaer Morhen. All"
Geralt, I'll have to see that to believe it.
Keira, Take the tome and read it. I...I truly do believe you'll find your
Geralt, Good idea.
Keira, Why'd we even come?
Keira, Meaning he knew they were looking for him.
Keira," The potion I gave him. Seems he saw a use for it, drank it."
Geralt," Strange. My medallion's trembling, but there's nothing here... What's"
Keira, It's an illusion. I sensed it as well. I expected we might run into
Geralt, Meaning what?
Keira," The Eye of Nehaleni. It dispels illusions. It's easy enough to build,"
Geralt," Hm, thanks."
Keira," Simple, isn't it?"
Geralt, Mhm. Let's see where the passage leads.
Keira," Do you feel that? A flow of fresh air, from the left. Must be an exit"
Geralt," Good, let's get outta here."
Keira, Wait. There's still the magic lamp.
Geralt, The magic what now?
Keira, Lamp. The elf promised it to me in exchange for my help. And since his
Geralt," Yeah, I'll help."
Keira," Splendid. Come, then."
Geralt, Gotta look for it alone. I should go to Crookback Bog. Think you can
Keira, Of course I can. Best of luck to you.
Geralt, I'll stop by. You can be sure.
Keira," In that case, I shall be waiting."
Geralt," See you, Keira."

Guard, Halt! Who goes there?!
Geralt, Baron home?
Geralt, A witcher. Wanna talk to him.
Guard, Seen this man before. Inn at the Crossroads. You bought us a round.
Geralt, It lead me here. Gotta talk to the baron.
Geralt, Something important. His ears only.
Guard," Fine. Lodrin, let 'im in. If he makes any trouble...well, we outnumber"
Geralt, Right. Guess I'll be going.
Geralt, A witcher. Wanna talk to him.
Geralt, Gonna let me in or not?
Guard," Eh, no passage for the likes of you."

Guard," Hm, all right, in you go. But cause any trouble and we'll gut you"
Geralt, Fine. Maybe another time.
Guard, Open the gate! Sergeant! Ardal! Witcher to see the baron! Don't want no

Sergeant, Had a choice after the Black Ones thrashed us -- let it lie and try

Man, Not bad.
Geralt," Listen, I gotta get inside the fortress. Can I do that without going"

Girl, Go away! Stupid wolves! Go!
Ciri, She needs help.
Ciri, You can come down! Hello there. Are you lost?
Girl," A little, I guess. Are you?"
Ciri, Yes. Though also just a little.
Girl, Does that mean...you know which way to go?
Ciri," Not quite, not yet. But I'm sure we'll find the way if we set off"
Ciri, I never lose my way.
Girl," Mmm. If that's true, what are you doin' so deep in the forest alone?"
Ciri, Looking for lost little girls.
Girl, What happened to you?
Ciri," This? Hm, it's...nothing."
Ciri, How did you wind up here?
Girl, My father brought me. Told me to follow the trail of treats and
Ciri, Why don't you tell me where you live.
Girl, In Lindenvale. They'd see to your wounds there.
Ciri, You and your father -- when did you leave home?
Girl, This mornin'.
Ciri, And did the sun warm your face or your back?
Girl, It warmed my back.
Ciri, So we must go east.
Ciri, How'd you wind up here?

Girl, Look! There's something there.
Ciri, Wait here. Don't come any closer.
Girl, But...
Ciri, No buts. Stay here. I must see something.
Ciri," Hmm... Bloodshot, but still moist. He died recently."
Ciri, Lips parted and bloated... Bit clear through his tongue. Immense pain
Ciri," Ah, his chest is crushed. Ribs probably pierced his lungs. Something"
Ciri," Hmm... Something tore his leg off. No, gnawed it off."
Girl," Eeew, that's horrible!"

Girl, Oil? You mean like we make from rapeseed?
Ciri," No, a far more special oil."
Girl, You're smart! How do you know these things? Did your father teach you?
Ciri, Not my father. My uncle. Uncle Vesemir.

Baron," ""Papa, is that deeh's wump on the other side of the wall?"" Pwhahaha..."
Baron, Our bedchamber. Tamara's room is there. Try not to make a mess. For

Geralt," The baron and his wife. Hm, look happy enough. What's this? Ah. Gotta"
Geralt," Damn, trail breaks off. Could find something else though."
Geralt, Hmm...spruce wood. Smells of juniper incense. Some sort of folk
Baron, Done pokin' around?
Geralt, Recognize this amulet?
Baron, Hmm... Yes. Anna began wearing it a time ago.
Geralt, Any idea where she got it?
Baron, None.
Geralt, Any witches or cunning women in the area?
Baron, A pellar. Old coot lives near Blackbough. And there's a cunning woman
Geralt, Oughta have a chat with this pellar.
Baron, Fair warning -- he's a hard man to talk to. Rumor has it he killed
Geralt, Not really interested in his hobbies. Just want to ask about the
Geralt, Found a doll in Tamara's room. Tell me about it.
Baron," Heh! What could possibly be so interesting about a doll, witcher?"
Geralt, Looks like it might've been used for some sort of black magic.
Baron," Black magic? Are you barmy?! I made it for her! She was four, perhaps"
Geralt," So it is supposed to be Triss. Yeah, I see it now. Eerie. Looks"
Baron," Doesn't it? Time's taken a bit of a toll, but overall, it continues"
Geralt, You got something to fall back on if things don't work out with
Geralt," This is Triss? No offense, but uh...not great with your hands, are"
Baron," Why don't you take some wood and rags, see what image of a grown"
Geralt, Found signs of a fight in the room. Know anything about that?
Baron, A fight? What're you talkin' about?
Geralt, Someone was attacked -- probably your wife or daughter. Whoever it
Baron," I...I don't know nothin' about this. That night...I was drunk, don't"
Geralt, Doubt you were the only ones in the castle. Maybe one of your men
Baron," Three times I asked those bastards if they'd seen anythin', heard"
Geralt, Whole landing smells of wine. Tell me anything about that?
Baron," One of the lads, must be. Lushes one and all."
Geralt, Give your men Erveluce?
Baron," Oh, dammit, I might've spilled it. I told you I was good and marinated"
Guard," Hey, look! Some stray's wandered our way."
Guard," Sod off, freak!"
Guard, What do you want?
Geralt, Wanna talk to the pellar.
Guard, Too late. We've got dibs on a chat with 'im. A long one.
Geralt, Maybe we can make a deal.
Guard," We'll not ploughin' bargain with anyone. Vengeance, that's what we"
Geralt, Think you need to leave now.
Guard, Do we?
Geralt, You do.
Guard," Well...let's go, then."
Guard," Aye, we oughta..."
Guard, But where'll we go?
Guard, Away from here.
Geralt, Get the hell out. Now.
Guard, Heheheh... And here I thought we'd have a day without corpses.
Guard, Heard mages pay top coin for the special bits of rare creatures.
Geralt, What do you want from him?
Guard, To give 'im what he deserves.
Geralt, And that is?
Guard, He done conjured augeries. Said something evil had made its nest
Guard," Ever since, Edric's lived in the outhouse, and he's got hardened"
Geralt, Just so happens I need the pellar alive. So if you agree to leave
Guard," Hmmm...well, all in all..."
Geralt, Yes or no?
Guard, Fine. Let's hear it.
Geralt," A tea of mullein leaves for his belly, and cover his boils with"
Guard," Noted. But if it don't work, we'll be back. Move out, boys!"
Guard, Any of you fellows know where this mullein shite grows?
Guard," My old lady'll know. Got a knack for herbs, she does. The other"
Guard," Heheheh, Edric's dumb as your milker. Should suit 'im."
Guard," All right, let's get Edric, pull 'im outta the shitter, stuff 'im"
Guard, And if he don't?
Guard, We'll visit the pellar one last time.
Geralt, Gotta wonder about a man who could get Edric's friends all worked up.
Pellar, Devils! Who do they bring?! What seek ye?
Geralt, I need your help.
Pellar," Ooh...a man -- nay -- a wolf, gray, though not old... 'Tis he the"
Geralt," Recognize this? Made of spruce wood, strong smell of juniper."

Pellar," Oh, the dear -- besieged, she was. Evil all around, wanting to"
Geralt, Old magic? Can you be more specific?
Pellar," Tis¹ naught for mouth-speech, nor for the touch. A small protective"
Geralt, Anna and her daughter are missing. Know where they are?
Pellar," Nay, no, nay. Pellar don't know. But the spirits could know. The"
Geralt," Spirits, great, fine with me. Long as I know where to look, where"
Pellar," Lost, lost...must be found... Princess! None better than Princess"
Geralt, Princess? Which princess?
Geralt, You make the amulet?
Pellar," Aye. Sure, 'twas the pellar. After the way of his forefathers, over"
Geralt, You were expecting me?
Pellar," Aye, as the bones declared I should. ""They shall come whose stench is"
Pellar, Princess! My goat! She's fled!
Geralt, Those men must've scared her off. Can we get back to the auguring?
Pellar," Without the goat? Impossible. No goat? Hmph, won't work!"
Geralt," Huh, will you help me if I bring the goat back?"
Pellar," Princess, Princess, where've you got to, girl?"
Geralt, Can't seriously think I'm gonna chase down your goat.
Pellar, A pellar without a goat makes for a mute prophet.
Geralt," Getting on my nerves, old man. I'm not going anywhere."
Pellar," No Princess, no prophecy, no augury."
Geralt, Fine. I'll get your goat.
Pellar," The bell! The little bell's ringing -- she loves it! Ring, ring, and"
Geralt," Yeah, treacherous as beasts go. I always keep an eye out for 'em."
Pellar," Princess! Flee not from the pellar, for there are wolves about! Goat"
Geralt," Happy for you, but I'm kinda in a hurry. Anna and Tamara? They might"
Pellar," The White Wolf helped the pellar, and so the pellar shall help him!"
Geralt, Can we talk about Anna and Tamara now? Know where they might be?
Pellar, Blood! We need blood. A living being.
Geralt, Fine. Be right back.
Geralt, Will this do?
Pellar, They are not here. They have gone. Blood! I see blood!
Geralt, Whose?
Pellar, No Anna...no Tamara...just a child.
Pellar," A child that lives not, yet did not die."
Geralt, Mentioned a child. Whose?
Pellar," Why, Anna's."
Geralt, Anna was pregnant?
Pellar, She was. And she miscarried.
Geralt," Hm, baron didn't mention it."
Pellar," Afraid, perhaps, or ashamed, or forgetful... Or perhaps he had no"
Geralt, The baron have anything to do with his wife's miscarriage?
Pellar," Foul-tempered he is, and he's a fondness for hooch."
Geralt, No doubt makes his temper even fouler. Did he abuse his family? Anna
Pellar," The pellar's old, near blind...but Princess came and licked her"
Geralt, So what?
Pellar," She's a wise beast, only comes to those who suffer."
Geralt, What happened to the child?
Pellar," In a grave thrown, without rite or ceremony, it awoke. Now it"
Geralt, A botchling.
Pellar," White Wolf, wise wolf. Catch the botchling, the botchling will"
Geralt, Botchlings suck the blood of pregnant women and eat their fetuses.
Pellar," Tis¹ a being cursed, and witchers lift curses. If the White Wolf"
Geralt, Anna tell you all this? Did she come here after it happened?
Pellar," Nay, not Anna. 'Twas the omens told me."
Geralt," Great, so I can be sure it's true."
Pellar," The omens need not your faith to be true, it is you who needs the"
Geralt, It's over? Is that it?
Pellar, That is it.
Geralt," Spirits had nothing more to say? Like, where they went, or where they"
Pellar," You came for an augury, and augur I did. They're gone. The child"
Geralt," Whatever I do, I gotta find the botchling first."
Pellar," Seek it at midnight, near the grave that lies empty."
Geralt," If what you say is true, the baron oughta know where that grave is."
Geralt, Why do you want its blood?
Pellar," Blood, blood, blood! It binds men for all ages -- the living and the"
Geralt," Sure, but what do you wanna do with it?"
Pellar," Atimes, a century's too short for two brothers to reconcile. One dies"
Geralt, Mhm. And what does the pellar do?
Pellar," He awaits Forefathers' Eve. He mixes the blood with milk, herbs and"
Geralt, I hear you right? You mention Forefathers' Eve? Pretty old custom.
Pellar, Death lurks in every bog and puddle 'round here. Folk know they could
Geralt, Heard of one witcher who lifted a botchling's curse. Never tried it
Pellar, And give it a name! Perform the Aymm Rhoin.
Geralt, The Ritual of Naming? That's an elven custom.
Pellar," Human, elven, dwarven...ancient. Spirits have no race, they honor not"
Geralt, Lightning strike?
Guard, Oswin? Where's Oswin? Anyone seen him?
Guard, Whaat?
Geralt, Fire! You blind? Nobody willing to put it out?
Guard, My brother's in the stable! We've got to save him -- he'll burn alive!
Geralt, See what I can do.
Guard," Hurry, now! Quick!"
Geralt, Somebody oughta see the baron before he burns the castle down.
Geralt, Dammit. Lots of smoke. Gotta hurry.
Stablemaster, Over here! Can't get out! Roof's collapsed!
Stablemaster, Good work!
Baron," Well? What will you say now?! Next time I ask you to drink, will I see"
Guard, No! No! N-Never!
Baron, I don't believe you!
Guard," Baron, sir! Colonel! Calm yourself before you burn the castle down!"
Baron, You dare tell me to calm down?! You?!
Guard, If Miss Tammy saw you like this--
Baron," Don't you mention my daughter! You! You took her, didn't you?! Admit it!"
Baron," • You, you...where do I know you from, eh? Ah, right! The witcher! Come,"
Geralt, I know your wife miscarried. Was that before or after you beat her to
Baron, What the fuck're you suggesting?!
Geralt," Don't play me for a fool. You'd been beating them for years. Finally,"
Baron, Aaarrrggghhh...
Baron, Fuckin' get out of here!
Geralt," They ran from you, didn't they?"
Baron, Lying prick!
Geralt, We need to talk.
Geralt, Sit down. You beat them.
Baron," I never laid a finger on Tamara, not once."
Geralt, And on Anna?
Baron, That's another story. She always knew how to spark my ire.
Geralt, You knew they had run away from the start.
Baron," Yes, I knew."
Geralt, Why didn't you tell me? Wasted my time.
Baron," Say I had? Say I'd said I had troubles, couldn't control my"
Geralt, Tell me everything you remember about the day they fled. The truth
Baron," I'd been soakin' myself for three days straight. Anna came to me,"
Geralt, Gotta admit I do think you're a prick. Not because you couldn't
Baron, What?
Geralt, Don't play the idiot. You gave them no choice.
Geralt, Doesn't much matter now. I know how to find them.
Baron, How?
Geralt, I know about the baby.
Geralt, Your wife -- how'd she make you so angry? Too much salt in the soup?
Baron," Twenty years we've known each other. She's seen me drunk and sober,"
Geralt, You beat her? For that? For criticizing you?
Baron," Argh, witcher, you haven't a clue, have you. Well, perhaps I shall"
Geralt, Expect me to believe you were a loving father to Tamara? After that
Baron," You're free to believe whatever you wish, but she was always the apple"
Geralt," Make it sound like she led a charmed life. If that's the case, why'd"
Baron, I'd hardly need you if I knew.
Baron," Anna...and I... It wasn't as it seemed, seems..."
Geralt," All right, I'm all ears. Tell me what happened. The truth this time."
Geralt, What happened next?
Baron," Next...it only got worse. I awoke at sunset, not knowin' how many"
Geralt, What did you do with the child?
Baron, Wrapped it in a clean sheet and buried it.
Geralt, Just like that.
Baron," Damn you! I gave no thought to a funeral. It was a horror, I wanted"
Geralt," Get hold of yourself. Men like you, when they break down, look"
Baron, You're a heartless bastard.
Geralt," Huh, mutations worked, then. But here's the good news -- your dead"
Geralt," I sympathize, I do."
Baron, Thank you. And know that I hope you find your Ciri.
Geralt, Deal we made means I need to find Anna and Tamara first. Just so
Geralt," Seen a lot of dead in my time, but that must've been hard."
Baron, Unspeakably so. My legs gave out. I saw fields of corpses at
Geralt, We don't know that yet. The amulet Anna wore -- could be linked
Geralt," Signs of a fight in the room -- hole in the wall, wine on the"
Baron, Aye. We tussled... She tried to whack me on the noggin with a
Geralt, Tamara present for all this? She see you quarrel?
Baron," Through the doorway, perhaps. She didn't enter the room. Shame, too"
Geralt, Don't much care what you have to say. I'm supposed to find your
Baron, What? How?
Geralt," Sometimes miscarried fetuses, if they don't get a proper burial, turn"
Baron," Into, fucking, what...?"
Geralt, A cursed creature that draws strength from killing pregnant women.
Baron, But how...how does it know?
Geralt," Blood ties. They're a strong bond, a bond I want to use to find your"
Geralt, Details you don't need to know. There's a bond of blood between this
Baron, How?
Geralt, One of two ways. Legends claim you can bury a botchling under the
Baron, And the other way?
Geralt, We kill it and draw some of its blood. Take that to the pellar and he
Baron," Do not kill my child. It's suffered enough already. Lift the curse, that"
Geralt," Whatever we do, we gotta find the botchling first."
Baron, I'll show you where I buried her. And I'll dig the grave at my
Geralt," If it turns out we can't transform the botchling into a lubberkin,"
Geralt," The sooner we resolve this, the better. Best do it tonight, at"
Baron, Then wait here with me. Near midnight I'll take you to where I
Geralt, Get word to the common folk. Oughta stay in their homes tonight and
Baron, Do I take a shovel? To dig up the grave?
Geralt," Take it. You'll need it, but not for that."
Geralt, Need to tend to something first.
Baron, Be quick. And me? What am I to do in the meantime?
Geralt, Sober up.
Geralt, Still not sure what to do.
Baron," Whatever you decide, we must put an end to my child's suffering."
Baron," A bit further, follow me."
Geralt, You give the child a name?
Baron, No... Why would we?
Geralt, Mistake. Names are powerful seals.
Baron, Here's the spot.
Geralt, Chose a lovely spot.
Baron," Dammit, will you relent? I ploughin' know I've done wrong."
Geralt, Good.
Geralt, The grave's dug up. And empty.
Baron, What's that mean?
Geralt, Botchling's on the prowl.
Baron, Look!
Geralt, Get back!
Geralt," Take it in your arms, quick!"
Baron, And if it goes garrity?! It'll bite us in the arse before we know it!
Geralt," Keep screaming and it will turn rabid. It's calm, for now."
Baron, Bloody hell. What happens when it gets ploughin' restless.
Geralt," It'll bite through your jugular, and you'll bleed to death before I"
Baron, Merciful gods!
Geralt, Back to the fortress.
Baron, What? With this?
Geralt," As I recall, you were the one who wanted to test the old legends,"
Baron, Oh fuck...
Geralt, Hungry specters. Botchling's scent attracted them.
Baron, On my mother's grave! Do something!
Baron," Pest take me, it's writhing somethin' fierce! I can't hold it! Calm it"
Baron," Ooph, ooph... Quiet now. But...but what do you want to do with it?"
Geralt," Me? Nothing. This is your job. Told you, gotta bury it under the"
Geralt, More coming. Need to hurry.
Baron, On with it! I'll not wait till they devour us!
Baron, Squirmin' again! Like a daft eel! I cannot hold it!
Baron, It worked. It stopped.
Geralt, Chosen a name?
Baron, No...
Geralt, So think of one. It's important.
Baron, It's...it's a girl. What would Anna have named her?
Baron, What now?
Geralt, Repeat after me. By the powers of earth and sky.
Baron, By the powers of earth and sky.
Geralt, By the world that was to be your home.
Baron, By the world that was to be your home.
Geralt," Forgive me, you who came but who I did not embrace."
Baron," Forgive me, you who came but who I did not embrace."
Geralt, I name thee -- say her name -- and embrace thee as my daughter.
Baron, I name thee Dea and embrace thee as my daughter.
Geralt, Good. Now bury the body.
Baron, Agh. What now?
Geralt, In one day's time Dea should turn into a lubberkin. I'll stay here and
Baron, I'll wait with you.
Geralt, Out of the question.
Baron," But...that's my child. And the guilt, the responsibility for all this"
Geralt," Time for parental impulses...it's long past. Besides, nothing else you"
Baron, But--
Geralt," No ""buts."" Just witcher's work left to do here. Gotta wait a day and a"
Geralt," By blood's power I summon you, with your name I beseech you. Hear my"
Geralt, *Sniffs* Ugh. Sure wasn't lavender they kept here. Might be worth
Geralt, Both were here. I'm going the right way. Wants to show me something
Geralt, Necrophages had a field day. Still worth a look. Should examine that
Geralt, A fisherman's hut. Seems she wants me to take a closer look.
Geralt, Hungry specters. Botchling's scent attracted them.
Baron, Bloody hell! You killed my child!
Geralt, You know I had to.
Baron," You were supposed to lift the curse! Save it, damn you! Not kill it!"
Geralt, Shut up before you wake someone. Last thing we need is a crowd.
Baron," Fuck it! I don't ploughin' care, hear me?! You killed my child!"
Geralt, I killed a botchling. Your daughter died a while back. Go home. Get
Geralt," Do anything stupid, and I'll kill you, too."
Baron, Go plough yourself! Kill me if you must. I've nothin' to live for
Geralt, You've got another daughter...and a wife. And the botchling's blood
Geralt, Forgive me. It couldn't be avoided. I truly am sorry.
Baron," Yeah, sure! Like hell, you're sorry!"
Geralt," Calm down. Go home. With a bit of luck, I'll be back soon with news"
Baron, What...what will you do with that blood?
Geralt, Me? Nothing. Just hope the pellar knows what to do with it. Go home.
Geralt, Got the botchling's blood. Know what to do? How to find Anna and
Pellar," Blood, blood, blood... The pellar knows, knows the ritual, ritual to"
Geralt," All right, let's see if these old rituals hold any sway in these"
Pellar, You wish to go right away?
Geralt," Yeah, don't see any sense in waiting."
Pellar, So shall it be.
Geralt, Gimme a bit. Gotta get ready.
Pellar, The pellar shall await you here.
Geralt," So, how will this ritual work?"
Pellar," A decoction the pellar shall brew, and when midnight tolls, off we"
Geralt, Mhm... We gonna need black candles?
Pellar," ""Step onto the path of blood anight, standing upon bare ground,"
Geralt, All right. What then?
Pellar," The pellar shall summon the spiritling, the babe's ghost, and it"
Geralt, Can I help? Bring any other ingredients?
Pellar," Hmm-hmm... Henbane...yes. Jimsonweed...aye. And lungwort. Ah, here's"
Pellar, The White Wolf must follow the pellar. The pellar will show the way.
Geralt, We got a long way to go?
Pellar," Nay, it's not far. Through the village, then the wood, and there we"
Geralt, All this the baron's land?
Pellar, Tis¹ now. 'Twere not before.
Geralt, So who'd it belong to?
Pellar," To the lord. Vserad they called him. An evil man he were. Vile, cared"
Geralt, You all get together and drive him away?
Pellar," When the Black Ones came, the lord to the tower on Fyke Isle fled. The"
Geralt, Local gods just aren't known to be tolerant.
Geralt, Nilfgaardians hit you pretty hard.
Pellar, Folk're poor here. It's rare the mighty concern themselves with the
Geralt, How's that?
Pellar, A pestilence grips their camp and will devour them all. As the mice
Pellar," Nearly there, nearly there..."
Geralt, What is this place?
Pellar, Shh...the Wolven Glade.
Geralt, Nice name. White Wolf should feel right at home.
Pellar," The White Wolf -- aye, good balance, for terrible things happened here"
Pellar, Here. The place.
Geralt, What now?
Pellar, Light the fires.
Geralt," All right, no reason to dawdle."
Pellar," Prepare, and prepare well. Once the spirits appear, there'll be no"
Geralt, Nothing like a little encouragement...
Pellar, Light the fires. The pellar will treat that as his sign to begin.
Geralt, The fires -- why do we need them?
Pellar, To keep malicious forces at bay. You must watch they do not go out!
Geralt, What'll come?
Pellar, Evil.
Geralt, What about you? What'll you do?
Pellar," The pellar must clear the stone, then draw the signs. Then to the"
Geralt, Ready.
Pellar," The fires, watch them. Let nothing break the circle."
Pellar, By the powers of the earth and sky! By the world that was to be your
Geralt, Dammit. Supposed to keep the fires lit.
Pellar," I see the blood of her blood! I see them bound! The blood calls. ""I'm"
Pellar, Why do you seek the child of Elder Blood? Nigh is the Time of the White
Geralt, You alright?
Pellar, Akh akh akh... Y-yes akh...
Geralt, Is it over?
Pellar, It's done. The pellar's seen what he was meant to see.
Geralt, Third vision seems most important.
Pellar," Hm, they were walking through the woods, both weak, but for different"
Geralt," Not sure I heard you right, but you mention a Voytek?"
Pellar, Hope filled both their hearts at the thought of him.
Geralt," Hm? And the prophecy at the end? Ithlinne's words, you quoted them,"
Pellar," Forgive the pellar, he knows not what you mean. Spirits, spirits"
Geralt, This Voytek from your vision -- know him?
Pellar, Voytek... Voytek... Two Voyteks have we nearabouts. In Blackbough
Geralt, And the other? Somehow I doubt they went to a century-old rodent
Pellar," A fisherman. A family he has, lives in a secluded hut near the"
Geralt, Time I was on my way. Thanks for your help.
Pellar," Refuse? Why, the pellar could never have refused. A man"
Geralt, You don't look like you can get home on your own. I'll walk you.
Pellar, Thank you.
Geralt, No. Thank you for your help. Let's go.
Geralt, Didn't fully understand what the second vision was about.
Pellar," Anna miscarried, blood everywhere. Suffering, the pellar felt it on"
Geralt, What did you see first?
Pellar," The pellar saw the baron and Missus Anna. They quarreled, he did not"
Boy, Who's that?
Woman," Other room. Go on, now."
Man," What ye seek here, sir? Our hut's out of the way, woeful. We 'as nothin',"
Geralt, They call you Voytek?
Voytek," I... I... They do, kind sir, but I's not done a thing. Swear it on"
Geralt, Just need information. Looking for two women -- the Bloody Baron's wife
Voytek," Not a soul abeen here, sir."
Geralt," Sure? Not even passing through? Daughter's medium height, about twenty,"
Boy," That's her came at night, right, mummy?"
Woman," Quiet, boy!"
Geralt," Where'd the girl go? Your son's said enough, no point in playing dumb"
Voytek," Sorry, sir, but ye don't look like one of her father's men."
Geralt," Because I'm not. I'm looking for Tamara and her mother, I need to"
Voytek," Tamara is, aye. She's to my brother's place in Oxenfurt. But Missus"
Geralt, Why?
Voytek," Cause¹...'cause he beat her, sir. Beat Missus Anna, I means. Everyone"
Geralt, What happened to Tamara's mother?
Voytek," Ach. 'Twere like this -- I was awaitin' in the old smokehouse, with"
Geralt, I want to help that woman. She could be in danger.
Woman," Young 'un's seen no one, m'lord. He's a kiddie, must 'ave dreamt it."
Geralt," I wanna hear this dream, then. So, kid, who did you see? Who came"
Boy," Pappy brought 'er at night, the lady does the medicines. She was all"
Geralt, What marks?
Voytek," They's...well...like burned on with a hot iron...on the palms, inside."
Geralt, Burned? Like a cattle brand?
Voytek," Aye, though these wasn't black scars, scabbed over. They's hot and"
Geralt," Fine, what happened next?"
Voytek," Grew even darker, seemed someone 'ad put out the stars. Crickets all"
Geralt, Why help them at all? You risked a lot.
Voytek," I'd a debt, owed Miss Tamara. Three moons past a fever gripped my boy."
Geralt, Married a wise woman.
Voytek, Cryin' shame we couldn't save Missus Anna in the end.
Geralt, While back I met a woman in Crookback Bog. Had fiery marks on her skin
Voytek, Must be her! Missus Anna! Gods...she to Crookback Bog...
Geralt, It's where I saw her last.
Voytek, Gods of all the heavens protect us... 'Tis clear now whose whisper
Geralt, It is?
Voytek," The Crones took her! She must've made a deal with 'em, a pact! It's"
Geralt, Thanks for your help.
Boy," The lady -- she'll be all right in the end, won't she?"
Geralt, I'll do what I can to see that she is.
Geralt," So here our paths diverge. Thank you, Dea. Go in peace."
Man, Remember me?
Geralt, Stable hand. Pulled you out of the fire.
Man," Won't ever forget that. Here, I'm grateful."
Sergeant," Witcher -- a word, please."
Sergeant, Believe we've not had the pleasure. They call me the sergeant.
Geralt, What is it?
Sergeant," That night when the baron ordered everyone to lock their doors,"
Geralt, No time.
Sergeant, This'll only take a minute.
Geralt," Gotta ask the baron about that. Speaking of which, know where he is?"
Sergeant, Garden. Spends a lot of time sittin' there of late.
Geralt, Drunk.
Sergeant," No. Don't drink, don't eat...just sits."
Geralt, There you are.
Baron, See the hollyhock there? The violet blooms? Brought the plants here from
Geralt, She brought death down on others. The sooner you start
Baron," Can't deny that. Doesn't make it any easier to live with,"
Geralt, Got some information about your family.
Baron, You've learned something? Let's go inside. It's a bit chilly out.
Geralt," Your loss -- it must hurt, bad. But there wasn't anything we could"
Baron," No, not now, not anymore. It was too late, that was clear... Shoulda"
Baron, Any news for me?
Geralt, Your daughter's in Oxenfurt.
Baron, What the blazes...?! She all right? In good health? Safe? Why haven't
Geralt, Never offered to do that.
Baron, How do you know she's safe? You see her at least?
Geralt," I saw her, we talked. She said I could tell you she's safe..."
Baron, When will she come home?
Geralt, And that she's not coming back.
Baron," She's not to return? But...I've prepared all for her, her rooms await."
Geralt, She's not coming back. Period. And I don't blame her. I wouldn't want

Geralt," You can always try. Wouldn't get my hopes up, though."
Baron, I shall try. I must. Life is pointless without her and Anna.
Geralt," No, but I talked to the man who helped her escape, and then took her"
Baron, I shan't trust some peasant dolt. I shan't trust whoever it is helped
Geralt, That much I can do.
Baron, I'm grateful. Take this -- call it enticement. And this may prove

Baron," Incidentally, what of my Annie? Learned anything?"
Baron," Very well, you were to find them both. What of Anna? Learned anything?"
Geralt," We'll talk about her, don't worry. But right now, you'll tell me"
Geralt, Nothing yet. But I'm on her trail.
Baron," Well, what're you waitin' for?"
Geralt, For you to tell me about Ciri. Like we agreed.

Baron," Some, aye. Others were not so fortunate. But what happened then...I must"
Geralt, Uh oh. I know that look.
Baron, You're a fast learner. You'll know the rest once you find my wife.
Geralt, Working on it.
Baron, And making piss poor¹ progress.
Geralt, They split up -- hadn't considered that possibility before. But don't
Baron," Wait, witcher! When you find my daughter, will you give her this?"
Geralt, A rag doll?
Baron, Uh-huh.
Guard, Halt! No passage.
Geralt, Case of the plague surface in the city or something?
Guard," The plague? Err, no. We're to not let folk in the city. It's an order,"
Geralt, This what you mean?
Guard," Lemme look at that... Hmm... Hmm... Missing a seal, the red one..."
Geralt, Impossible...

Geralt, What kind of pass're we talking about?
Guard," Well, a normal one, a transit pass."
Geralt, Who issues them?
Guard, How should I know? I'm a lowly soldier...
Geralt, Who ordered the city gates closed?
Guard," Word is, the king himself. Doesn't want paupers and refugees pissing"
Geralt, Farewell.
Geralt," I'm looking for Tamara, the Bloody Baron's daughter. Your brother said"
Man," Voytek send you, sir?"
Geralt, How else would I know she was here?
Man, Wait a moment. I'll fetch her straight away.
Tamara, You're looking for me. And who might you be? My father send you?

Geralt," You're right, your father's a jackass."
Tamara," Glad we agree. But in that case, why are you helping him?"
Geralt, Your father's a vile man. You're angry and bitter -- can't blame you.
Tamara," Why do you help him, then? Why did you take this job?"
Geralt, Because he knows something about someone dear to me. Promised to
Tamara," Got it. A bit of blackmail -- just his style. Well, now you've found"

Tamara, Thank you for respecting my choice. Farewell.
Geralt, Gave Tamara your gift.
Baron, How'd she react?
Geralt, Probably not like you'd have wanted. She threw the doll away.
Baron," Threw it away? Oh gods, I'd hoped, despite all... Argh... Ahh... What"
Geralt," Still don't know anything specific, but I'm on her trail"
Baron," Well, will you stand there like a knob? Find her!"
Geralt, Got news of your wife.
Baron," Ploughin' hell, why'd you not say so forthwith? Where is she?! Why have"
Geralt," She's in Crookback Bog. Got food, a place to live, and keeps herself"
Baron," You were to bring her back, not report on the conditions she lives"

Baron," You still think me rotten to the core, a base bastard, don't you?"
Geralt," Actually, that's exactly what I think."

Baron, What would you have me do?! Sit on my arse and wait for her
Geralt, I've warned you. What you do -- that's your business.
Geralt," Venturing into the swamp, even with armed men, is just a bad idea."
Baron, I'll not sit on my arse waiting for them to return her! Would you
Geralt, Probably not. But I'm a witcher.
Baron, And I'm a husband and a father who's fucked up his life and the
Geralt," Your wife is with the Crones, as their servant."
Baron, What the fuck do you mean? What Crones?
Geralt, Ones who live in Crookback Bog.
Baron," Oh, I've heard folk speak of them, but thought it naught by tales"
Geralt, They fled by night. They were riding past the forest when a beast
Baron, A beast? Bloody hell... And Tamara -- was she hurt?
Geralt, No.
Baron," Ah, thank the gods for that. So, Annie -- what happened to her?"
Geralt," The creature carried her deep into Crookback Bog. Didn't harm her,"
Baron," Content? What is this tripe, witcher? What in bloody blazes is she"

Geralt, Guess they call you the Bloody Baron for a reason after all...
Baron, What?
Geralt, Your nickname. Makes sense now.
Baron," No, no, that's an entirely different story."
Geralt, Still seems like your fault to me.
Baron, Will you let me finish?
Geralt, We had a deal. I've done my part. Your turn to do yours.
Baron, A word once given... Now what did I last...?
Geralt, Basilisk. It'd just attacked you.
Baron," Ah, right. Gargantuan. One solid brute. It landed right in front of us."
Baron, She mounted and rode off. It grew awfully empty without her...

Geralt," Long story, but I know he's the key to finding her. I need to take"
Baron," Hmm... If it'll help you find your daughter, I'd be a pure bastard"
Baron, The witcher here's gonna take Uma. No one's to get in his way.
Guard," Aye, sir."
Geralt, Where'd you find him?
Geralt," Hmm... Doesn't look like a monster, but my medallion's trembling."
Baron," Funny story, actually. I won him in a game of cards."
Geralt, Funny story? How so?
Baron," Went to Novigrad once, to rest, indulge in the city's pleasures."
Geralt, Proper baron now -- even got a jester.
Baron, Aye... Though I feel something's not right with him.
Geralt, How so?
Baron," Well, he seems more beast than man, but there's wisdom, cunning in"
Geralt, No. But he doesn't look dangerous.
Baron," Hmm...I guess that's that. Doesn't eat much, so as long as he's no"
Geralt, Hilarious. Real side-splitter.
Baron," Ohh, you wouldn't know a good tale from a runny fart."
Geralt, Must've been pretty desperate to play for that.
Baron," Ah, quit your carping, smartarse. Someone wagered him, so we played."
Geralt, Uma? Strange name.
Baron," Aye, strange. But he gave us no other."
Geralt, You mean he can talk?
Baron, Hardly... It was like this -- I asked what they call him. He sat

Ciri, At Kaer Morhen.
Guard," Witchers' school there, aye. But they only took lads, as I recall."
Ciri, They made an exception for me.

Geralt," Could give you more, on one condition -- you tell me where you drop"
Beggar, I drop 'em with m'lady. Serious trouble if I didn't.
Geralt, I think you take them to the Putrid Grove.
Geralt, Go on lying like that and you won't get a thing.
Beggar," I swear it! Honest as a child, I am, m'lord."
Geralt, I know you pay tribute to the King of Beggars. Don't have a choice.
Beggar," Far as I'm concerned, the King of Beggars can stick his crown up his"

Geralt, There. Now tell me where the Putrid Grove is. It's the least you

Geralt, You didn't tell me anything.
Beggar, I don't know nothin'. On your way -- I've no use for you.
Geralt, So long.
Beggar," Sir, sir! Be merciful. Give us a crown, eh? Me mum's sick and if I"
Geralt, Here.
Beggar," Thank you, you gold-hearted man! Care to hear me tale o' woe?"
Geralt, Some other time. I'm in a hurry.
Geralt," All right, I'll give you some coin, but you gotta tell me where the"
Beggar," I don't know that. Keep your coin, I don't know a thing. Move on."
Geralt, Get out of my way.
Beggar, What a crown to a gentleman like you? Easy as spitting!
Geralt, Piss off while I'm still willing to let you go.
Geralt, Open up!
Man, Who are you and what d'you want?
Geralt, Take a look. Whaddaya see?
Man," Yellow eyes... Pair o' swords... Mutated killer, methinks..."
Geralt, Heard this place was a meeting spot for oddities.
Man, Heard right. Know the password -- get in free. Don't know it -- gotta

Man," Oh... Welcome to the grove, brother."
Geralt," Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
Man, Nope. Not the password.
Geralt, Don't know the password.
Man," Pay up, then."
Geralt, I like to tiptoe through the tulips.
Man, Nope. Not the password.
Geralt, Don't know the password.
Man," Pay up, then."
Geralt, Doing some sightseeing. Kinda curious about what's beyond this gate.
Man, My brother-in-law was curious. Worms been eatin' him for five years now.
Geralt, Farewell...
Man, I fare just fine without your wishes. Don't come again!
Geralt, Catch.
Man, You may enter. Oop. Right after you leave me your weapons. They'll be
Geralt, Fine. Make sure you don't lose them.
Man, No worries. Be waitin' for you once you're done with the king.
Geralt, Not in the habit of parting with my swords.
Man," In that case, we must part. Sod off, now."
Geralt, I won't pay. Let me in.
Man," Yes, sir."
Geralt, Might be a problem there.
Man, Then come back once you've solved it.
Bedlam," So, how are things?"
Triss, Good. More and more people come to our secret clinics looking for help.
Bedlam, Menge's hounds not scarin' 'em off any more?
Triss, I guess incurable disease is more terrifying than torture.
Bedlam," In that case, I'll count on more tribute comin' in."
Triss, You already take eighty percent of what we receive.
Bedlam," Aye, but don't forget it's me who secures the nooks and crannies where"
Bedlam," Bout¹ time we made something clear, sorceress."

Bedlam, Anyone can be bought...but like as true -- Menge'd cost me a

Bedlam, City Council is a puppet troupe with the heirarchy of the Church of the

Bedlam, One day the so-called free city of Novigrad will be truly free. But
Geralt, Apparently not. Cheering crowd at the execution -- mostly adults.
Bedlam, Any crowd of rabble'll cheer to the stench of burning flesh. But one

Triss," Helping me to survive, actually."
Geralt," Six months ago, if someone had said Triss Merigold would be working for"
Triss, Six months ago Triss Merigold parted ways with someone very dear to her
Man," Madame sorceress, beautiful as ever. Damn shame to part."
Triss," Don't fret, bound to be back soon."
Triss, I take it you're in Novigrad on important business?
Geralt, Important doesn't do it justice. I'm looking for someone.
Triss, More precisely?
Geralt, Young woman who's like a daughter to me.
Triss, Her?! Here?! No. Impossible.
Geralt," She was here -- there're witnesses, evidence. Was hoping you'd heard"
Triss," I'll do everything I can, of course. Who might know more?"
Triss," Hello, Kluhg. Manage to get those magic incense ingredients?"
Kluhg," Yes...somewhat with, uh, difficulties, you might say. I was walking"
Triss," Get to the point, Kluhg. No time today for one of your long stories."
Kluhg, Wait! A sack full of magicalities and they were coming straight towards
Triss," I need that package, Kluhg. I've got a contract."
Kluhg, It must be on the canal bed. Luckily it was heavy enough to sink. I'm

Geralt, I can do that. Where'd you toss the package?
Kruhg, Near the crane. Second bridge in from the harbor.
Triss, I didn't expect such devotion.
Geralt, Wanted to freshen up anyway. Let's go.
Geralt, Well...some causes require a sacrifice.
Triss, Causes...what about people?
Geralt, For people...same holds true.
Triss, So maybe you'd care to dive in after that sack for me?
Geralt, You win.
Kluhg, Stop... Hear that...? They've come for us.
Guard, The fool didn't break until I began to prick his heels.
Guard," Every man's got his sensitive spots. Interrogated a mage once, pain"

Geralt, Current must've carried the sack seaward. I'll swim towards the port.
Triss, Maybe some other time.
Geralt, Don't know what you're missing. Water's thick with pungent oils.
Triss," Find the parcel, or did you get wet for no reason?"
Geralt," Nothing like a refreshing swim in a filthy canal. Found a few fish, a"
Triss, My package. Hope the contents aren't soaked through. You're a doll.
Geralt, Seem to be in your element.
Triss," Still remember my elements, how I use them?"
Geralt," Come on, six months isn't that long. And it's not like I'm senile."
Triss, But you do have a history of amnesia.
Geralt," I've recovered my memory, completely."
Triss, Good. That should stop people from taking advantage of you.
Geralt, Someone's been taking advantage of me?
Triss," I have, for one."
Geralt, I've never even intimated--
Triss, We need to hurry.
Brandon," Greetings, sorceress."
Triss," Greetings, Brandon."
Brandon, I didn't expect you to bring company.
Geralt, Is that a problem?
Brandon," By the Eternal Fire, no! I'm surprised, that's all. Together I"
Geralt," Triss, you told this man you're a sorceress?"
Brandon, Of course. She was looking for work -- that's her chief asset.
Geralt, Are you Triss?
Triss," I know it was reckless, but competition's stiff here. No one would"
Brandon, More importantly no one would believe such a beauty could be an
Brandon, But I prefer you not to tarry and begin.
Geralt," Triss, you and Brandon here -- you've agreed on a price?"
Triss, We've settled on a full coin purse.
Brandon, Brandon and Co. is a serious outfit. We've the largest granary in all
Geralt," All right, then...let's get to work."
Geralt, Don't much like merchants who flatter with cheap praise before the
Brandon, That was not cheap praise! I was merely stating a fact.
Geralt, So am I. I want you to pay in full in advance.
Brandon, I'm afraid that's impossible.
Geralt, Then trap your own rats.
Brandon," Well, now I know why she brought you along. Fine. A full purse of"
Geralt," You're a merchant, familiar with how commerce works."
Brandon, Of course. Honest pay for honest work.
Geralt," Half up front, half once the job's done."
Brandon, You're asking a great deal.
Geralt, I'm a witcher. Gotta admit I've met my share of people who say one
Brandon," Hm, very well. Your first installment."
Triss, We need to place these crystals around the granary. Near anything that

Triss," Geralt, we'd both rather be somewhere else. I'd rather be in a royal"
Geralt," Once we place this incense, what then?"
Triss, I'll cast a spell and the rats will leave.
Geralt, Can't do that without sprinkling incense? Don't really feel up to
Triss, Stop whining!
Geralt, I don't like that guy.
Triss, Brandon? I don't either. He's much too fat.
Geralt, Can't help but agree. But no -- notice how he didn't try to haggle?
Triss, Must really want the rats out.
Geralt, Triss...he's a merchant. He makes his living by haggling.
Triss," If I'd worried about that sort of thing, I'd starve to death in this"
Geralt, Think I plugged every hole in there.
Triss, All right. Get ready for some magic fireworks. Once I activate the

Triss, I understand him perfectly.
Geralt," I know. Thing is, he was lying to himself."
Triss, I think he just didn't have much of a choice...
Geralt," We all lie sometimes. But lying to yourself is running away, whereas"
Triss, Sometimes you have to escape to forget. Your friend might've dwelled
Geralt, You could be right. But only he knows the truth...
Triss, We're only ever the ones to know the truth about ourselves.
Geralt, Which we share at times with those we hold dear.
Triss, Even if it's hard to swallow?
Geralt, Even then.
Triss, Who knows...maybe one day...
Geralt, I was worried about seeing you again. Doubted it could be pleasant...
Triss, We said everything there was to say six months ago. I don't want to go
Geralt, I'm not going back to it. It's just... It's one thing to say
Triss, We promised to remain friends. I hope nothing'll change that.
Triss," So, tell me how Yen's doing?"
Geralt, How do you know I found her?
Triss, You didn't answer my question. How's Yen?
Geralt, She's fine.
Triss, That's good.
Geralt, Not bad...
Geralt, Don't know yet.
Geralt, Asking about anything specific?
Triss, Never mind. I got my answer.
Brandon," Well, well... Our lovebirds having themselves a chat instead of"
Triss," The job's done. Geralt, those are--"
Geralt," I know who they are, Triss."
Brandon," My friends...begged me to notify them if I encountered a mage,"
Triss," It's a trap, Geralt."
Geralt, This stank from the start.
Brandon," Such a sharp sense of smell, you should've legged it while you had"
Geralt, I don't generally leg it. Here's what I think you should do: pay up
Brandon, Don't be ridiculous. I didn't hire a sorceress in order to pay her.
Hunter," Take my advice, mutant. If it's not your business, stay out of it."
Geralt," Thank for the advice, but...I can't take it."
Brandon, I paid in advance because I knew I'd recover my coin.
Triss, Such is life for sorceresses in Novigrad these days.
Geralt, I can see that and I don't like it. So here's what I think: the
Hunter, They'll do no such thing.
Brandon," You don't set the terms, mutant."
Hunter, Stay out of it. We're here for the witch.
Geralt," We're inseparable, see? Afraid you'll have to take us both."
Triss, Geralt!
Hunter, If you say so...
Geralt, All right. We've talked. Do what you gotta. Just remember...I can't
Hunter, Heard enough from this whoreson.
Brandon, As have I. Neither is to leave here alive.
Triss, That bastard hired me on the assumption he wouldn't have to pay me!
Brandon," Don't kill me! Good sir, no... They forced me... Had I not told them,"
Geralt," Shut up. I should kill you. Thing is, you're no good to anyone but the"
Brandon, Ff... Fine... Your coin...
Geralt, Now get!
Triss," Thanks, Geralt."
Geralt, You should try to keep better company.
Triss, He was still better than some mages.
Geralt, No need. Glad I could help.
Triss," You know, I've been thinking...who might know something about Ciri. And"
Geralt, Never trusted in dreamers' abilities myself.
Triss, Corinne's been very effective -- you should at least try. She's taken
Geralt, Not coming with me?
Triss, I've got some things to take care of.
Geralt, Another rat-infested warehouse?
Triss, Not exactly. Nothing even remotely satisfying. Such are the times.
Geralt, It was nice to see you again.
Triss," You too, Geralt. You should go now, before Corinne Tilly goes back"
Geralt, What if I want to find you?
Triss," I live in the Bits, near the fish market. Stop by. It'd be nice."
Geralt, All right -- see you later.
Geralt," Thanks for everything. See you, Triss."
Triss, Mhm. See you.
Geralt, How do I find you if I need you...?
Triss, I live in the Bits. Head up the hill past the fish market. Stop by.
Geralt, Be seeing you.

Rudolf," You've come to the right place, then. Corinne is inside... Been there"

Rudolf, I'm a banker. Cursed homes scare me -- do you know how a haunting

Tilly," Put it down, please... That's blood... Don't spill it... Please..."
Geralt, Wake up. It's just a dream. Wake up!
Tilly, The doll... The attic...
Geralt, All right. Time to check the attic.
Geralt, Way to the next room is blocked.
Geralt," Another masterpiece. An oven and a blackened grate. Oh joy, a riddle..."
Sarah," Boo! Did I scare you? Scared you, didn't I? Can tell you was scared."
Geralt," I wouldn't do that anymore if I were you, Sarah. You might scare"
Sarah, Why would someone hurt me? Havin' a spot o' fun's not allowed anymore?
Geralt, What're you playing?
Sarah," That lady fell asleep, and I've sent her some horrible dreams. I'll not"
Geralt," Very funny. Thing is, I gotta talk to the dreamer, so I'd like you to"
Sarah, Little Sarah doesn't want her to wake. Little Sarah wants to play.
Geralt, You're lucky. I know you're a harmless godling. But others might not
Sarah," And how d'you know I'm a godling, eh? How's that, eh? Eh?"
Geralt," If it looks like one and acts like one... Trust me, you're a godling."
Geralt," The way you play, well, it's only ever fun for you."
Sarah, That's 'cause you're a dullard. All you humans are dullards!
Geralt," You give the dreamer nightmares, and won't let her wake up. Why are you"
Sarah, I'm not tormenting anyone. Scary dreams are great. What I love is when

Sarah," Tell you a secret. The house ain't haunted, not one bit! I just pretend"
Geralt," Gave the banker a really big scare. See, he paid a lot for this house"

Geralt," Sarah, Novigrad's no place for a godling, but if you want to live"
Sarah, A deal? What kind?
Geralt," Leave the dreamer alone. In exchange, I'll tell the banker the house"
Sarah, You'd tell him that? What if he doesn't believe you?
Geralt, I'm a witcher. He'll believe me.
Sarah," Yes, yes, yes! Do that and I promise not to bother your friend. Not"
Geralt, I don't hear that often. Thanks.

Geralt," See now, wanna do this the nice way, but you just won't let me..."
Sarah," What'll you do to me, eh? Eh? Eh?"

Sarah," Akh akh akh... You pig! Tryin' to suffocate me, you oaf, you dolt!"

Geralt, Triss Merigold sent me to see you...
Tilly, Gods... Horrible nightmares. I was supposed to dream the history of this

Rudolf, Excellent! I must admit the experience has put me off the building

Geralt," A bit of both. A demon had captured Corinne. I managed to free her,"

Tilly, By destiny?
Geralt, By something more.
Tilly, Thank you. Would you be willing to share another memory?
Geralt, No. Let's continue.
Geralt, Yes.
Tilly, No need to rush. We have time.
Geralt, Ciri was orphaned. During the second war with Nilfgaard. Had no idea

Geralt," Hmm... Not a bad idea. Dandelion's pretty loose-lipped, might've"
Zoltan, That's what I'm countin' on.
Zoltan," Hm... We should divide these somehow... Perhaps... Ah, fuck it."
Zoltan," I'll ask the lasses on my half, you interrogate the ones on yours. Suit"
Geralt," Zoltan, wait. This is in verse."
Zoltan, And you figure that's unnatural because...?
Geralt, Wonderful. Meet me back here when you're done. Share our findings...
Zoltan," Right y'are. Need to do a wee bit o' tidyin' 'fore I go, can't stomach"
women," Louisa la Valette,"
Geralt, Still here? Looking for something?
Zoltan," Ah, just checking to see that everythin's in place. Buggers mighta"
Geralt," Actually, glad you're still here. Wanted to ask you about someone."
Geralt," Though well she knows the touch of silk and lace, she shuns not straw"
Zoltan, Molly. Keeps things tidy for the Baroness la Valette.
Geralt," A baroness within reach, and he settled for a chambermaid?"
Zoltan, Dandelion's not one to judge folk by their station -- you know that.
Geralt," Yeah, guess the true poet observes life in all its aspects, examines"
Geralt," If I didn't now any better, I'd say he was jealous about this"
Zoltan," Argh, doubt it. Former pupil, and, well, the tales he told me 'bout"
Geralt, Doubt I want to hear them...
Zoltan, Probably better off not. Things 'tween them took a turn for the
Geralt, Meaning?
Zoltan," She had him wearin' mummer's costumes, took to callin' him Christian,"
Geralt," Hm, truly perverse."
Zoltan," Ye dinnae ken the half of it! Called 'im her stallion, once --"
Geralt, Vespula...Name rings a bell... She threw his knickers out the window?
Zoltan, That's her.
Geralt, Hollered something about him being a scoundrel with a voice like a
Zoltan, That's her.
Geralt, Threw flower pots at him?
Zoltan, Guess old flames never die.
Geralt," Like a rose abashed of its crimson hue, fair Rosa would sink into"
Zoltan," Heheh, Dwarf's what Rosa var Attre named her gwyhyr. Well chosen, eh?"
Geralt, All right. But var Attre? Her dad happen to be the Nilfgaardian
Zoltan, He is. You know 'im?
Geralt, Wouldn't say that. Had a brief conversation with him at the palace in
Zoltan," Well, then you've a good notion to the kind of bloke he is."
Geralt, How dare she reject the great bard in favor of a common swordmaster?
Zoltan," More than one, it seems. Week on week we get fresh gossip 'bout her"
Geralt," A figure most rare, her nature dual. Look deep in her eyes, or be"
Zoltan," Err, not without reason... Never been much for elven women meself,"
Geralt," You wanna take this one, then?"
Zoltan," Nah, you can have her."
Geralt, Why?
Zoltan, You see...elven beauty's like a young Beauclair wine. Whereas I
Geralt," Well, know about all I wanted to know. Thanks for your help."
Thug, Junior claims you agreed to pay him more.
Vespula," But what we didn't and couldn't agree is that there'd be a war, now,"
Thug, Quite a coincidence that's what I aim to do to you.
Vespula," I will give you every last copper -- with interest. Gimme a week,"
Thug," Whoreson's no banker. He's an honest man -- you pay on time, you get"
Vespula, Help!
Thug," What you hollerin' for, stupid wench! What you hopin' for, a knight in"
Geralt, Close enough.
Thug," Keep outta this, grayhead. Not your concern."
Geralt, Take this coin and leave.
Thug, That ain't how it works. Vespula's to pay...or be taught a lesson.
Geralt," Already given her a verbal repremand. Now go, before I teach you a"
Thug, Come on... Gold's gold.
Geralt, Vespula's got someone else's protection now.
Thug, Really? Whose'd that be?
Geralt, The King of Beggars'. Made a deal with Junior. This is his turf now.
Thug, Didn't hear nothin' about that.
Geralt, But you have heard what Bedlam does to people who cross him? Or you
Thug," C'mon, Fritz... Boss wants it that way, it's how it's gotta be."
Geralt, Mine. Offered her a better rate.
Thug," All right. Let's see if you're a good bargain, or just cheap shit."
Geralt, Go. Now.
Thug," Now listen... You might have two swords, but there's four of us..."
Geralt, Yeah... Four men. Collecting tribute from one washerwoman. Don't
Thug, Best think again.
Vespula," Thank you, oh thank you! To think there're men who'll help a stranger"
Geralt," Not entirely outta kindness, and you're not entirely a stranger."
Vespula," What're you...? Oh, I know you! You're that witcher took Dandelion out"
Vespula," Covered in blood -- all of it! So much work, for naught."
Geralt, No need to thank me. It was nothing.
Vespula," Sorry... Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful, but... Everything I had..."
Geralt, Not Jerald...Geralt.
Vespula, Oh... Dreadful sorry.
Geralt, Whaddaya think... Where could Dandelion be?
Geralt, Don't know if you remember -- we've met.
Vespula," I don't-- Wait, wait! I know you! You're that witcher I near"
Geralt," When you kicked Dandelion out...through the balcony. Actually, he's"
Geralt, Not Jerald...Geralt.
Vespula, Oh... Dreadful sorry.
Geralt," Explain something, if you don't mind... You say I took Dandelion out"
Vespula," So he said. Claimed I was his one and only, but he fell in with the"
Geralt," ...song. He pick that habit up from us, too? Gotta have a word with"
Geralt, Relax... It'll come out in the wash.
Vespula, Course it will. Just gotta soak it in white vinegar -- but that's
Geralt, Sorry... Didn't think about that.
Vespula," A woman's lot... Men have their fun, and we're stuck with the mess."
Vespula," Probably out whorin', that hoarse pheasant, that lyin' scoundrel!"
Geralt, Ouch... What'd he do to get your goat?
Vespula," Same thing as ever. Prize bullshitter came back, sayin' it was till"
Geralt, This woman he was with in the harbor... Who was she?
Vespula," Claimed she was his niece from Kovir -- hah! Whore-vir, more"
Geralt, An artist?
Vespula, Or a whore.
Geralt," Apparently Geralt was seeing a trobairitz, a blonde, most likely."
Vespula," That's the one! Wait, what was her¹ name... Callonetta! Sounds"
Geralt," Dandelion asked you about other washerwomen? Not terribly subtle,"
Vespula, Maybe he likes 'em sudsy?
Geralt," Uh, maybe... But what'd he ask about -- exactly?"
Vespula," Oh, this and that, really... What's it like at the bathhouse, have"
Geralt, Thanks for your help. Listen -- when I find Dandelion...anything I
Vespula," No! I mean... Tell him he's a two-faced snake, but...it would be"
Geralt, I'm a friend of Dandelion's. Looking for Elihal.
Elihal, You've come to the right spot. How might I be of service? Need
Geralt, You Elihal?
Elihal, Yes. Now pick your jaw up off the floor.
Geralt," Sorry, I thought...thought Elihal was one of Dandelion's girlfriends."
Elihal," Ahhh, so it's that. Wait here."
Elihal, Any better?
Geralt, So you're...
Elihal, Elihal.
Geralt, Did you and Dandelion...I mean -- how'd you two meet?
Elihal, I met him one night in a tavern. He was blind drunk...
Geralt, What happened?
Elihal, What do you think? We spoke.
Geralt, That's it?
Elihal," I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I should make one thing"
Geralt, Don't think I wanna know what happened next...
Elihal," Oh, stop. He wasn't so drunk as not to figure it out. Besides, men"
Elihal," Luckily, Dandelion's an open-minded fellow. We had a lovely evening."
Geralt, Dandelion visit your shop often?
Elihal, I tried many times to talk him into a decent doublet. Sadly he'd only
Geralt, When'd you last see him?
Elihal," Some time ago... He brought in one of Zoltan's jerkins, insisted I"
Geralt, What did you and Dandelion talk about? He ask about anything in
Elihal," Hmm... Let me think... Had an ordinary chat, really. Although..."
Geralt, Kalkstein's in Novigrad? Wouldn't mind seeing him myself.
Elihal," You're too late, I fear. The witch hunters nabbed him recently,"
Geralt, Really. What'd they spell?
Elihal," ""Radovid sucks flaccid cock."""
Geralt," I know this is none of my business, but why do you..."
Elihal," Why do I dress up? As a child, I dreamt of becoming a doppler when I"
Geralt, Mhm...
Elihal, Have you never thought to become someone else -- even for a moment?
Geralt, I manage to stay interested.
Geralt, Thanks for your help. And...nice to meet you.
Elihal," I can help with much more. If you need new trousers or a vest, you"
Geralt, This Baroness la Valette's villa?
Sentry, Shouldn't interest you. The baroness don't mingle with just anyone.
Geralt," Don't worry. I'm here to see her chambermaid, Molly."
Sentry, Out of the way. Baroness is ridin' out. Begone.
Morvran," Greetings, witcher. I must admit it's curious to see you here. I don't"
Louisa, Geralt of Rivia. Slayer of monsters...and my son.
Geralt," You're right, general. My visit's no accident. I'm looking for someone."
Louisa," There's no one here who wishes to see you. Captain, this man is not to"
Morvran," Kill a woman's son, then appear on her doorstep? My, my, I thought"
Geralt," Looking for a girl named Molly, heard she works here."
Morvran, I fear your information's out of date. Molly no longer works here.
Geralt, Baroness fire her?
Morvran, Quite the contrary. Molly decided she no longer wished to serve.
Geralt, Seem to know who Molly is. You also know she doesn't work here
Morvran, This time of day? Probably sipping punch and considering which horse
Geralt, Not in the mood for jokes.
Morvran, I jest you not.
Morvran," After Aryan's demise, Louisa's nephew came to pay his respects. Got"
Geralt," All right, so where'll I find the newly-minted Lady l'Attard?"
Morvran, Our dear little Molly has a new passion -- horse racing. To my
Geralt, Gotta wonder if Molly fell for the nephew or his inheritance.
Morvran, We cannot know that just yet. But I'd wager she has strong feelings
Louisa," Geralt of Rivia at my doorstep? Surely, this is no chance encounter?"
Geralt," Greetings, Baroness. Greetings, General. You're right. I'm here for a"
Louisa," There's no mistaking you. But for etiquette's sake, Mary Louisa la"
Geralt, We've met before...
Morvran," And how! Imagine this, Louisa -- the emperor desired a chat with the"
Louisa, Hm... So Geralt of Rivia now works for Emperor Emhyr...
Geralt," Yeah, we had an opportunity to, uh...talk when the emperor summoned"
Louisa," Had you run afoul of var Emreis? No, you'd be long dead if that were"
Geralt," Looking for a girl named Molly, heard she works here."
Louisa, My maid-servant. I'm afraid she's currently at the home of my dear
Morvran, Perhaps Geralt could accompany us. He could speak with Molly at the
Louisa," Is that something you'd consider, witcher? Care to partake of some"
Geralt, Think I can find my own way to the Vegelbud home.
Morvran, Very well... Perhaps I can convince you to join me later at the
Geralt," Well, if Molly'll be there..."
Morvran," On our way, then."
Morvran, We've arrived.
Louisa," Soothing, the scent of the freshly cut lawn."
Morvran, Not all appreciate it. The races are a privilege of the wealthy.
Louisa, Some of the wealthy are too occupied minding their wealth to appreciate
Morvran," Fortunately, you do not number among them, m'Lady."
Louisa, Perhaps because the imperial army seized most of my wealth?
Morvran," We meet again, witcher."
Geralt," Yeah, managed to get here. Truth be told, hard to miss an estate this"
Geralt, Nice place.
Morvran, I see you managed to find the place.
Geralt," Not that hard. It's not exactly a small, concealed hovel."
Morvran," I must say of all the creatures in this region, I find steeds most"
Geralt, All the same to me. Call each one I ride Roach.
Morvran," Strange... The gray is Cantarella. Sired by Cahir, the champion from"
Geralt, Yeah... Gray's a good color. Even looks good on horses.
Morvran, My coin's on the black stallion -- Nemrod. Purest Nilfgaardian
Louisa," My father owned a similar estate in Brugge. As a young girl, I'd"
Morvran," Shall we look at the horses? Do you like horses, Geralt?"
Geralt, I guess so. Called every horse I've had Roach.
Morvran," The gray mare is Cantarella. Sired by Cahir, the champion from Vole."
Geralt," Gray's a nice color. For horses, too."
Morvran, My coin's on the black stallion -- Nemrod. Purest Nilfgaardian stock.
Geralt," Surprised he didn't salute you, general."
Geralt, Seem to know your horses.
Louisa," ""Know"" is not the word. Morvran's a true expert."
Morvran, I find them to be far more honest than men.
Geralt, Know anything about the chestnut or the bay?
Morvran," The chestnut is Thunderbolt, a pureblood Redanian. Gallant steed,"
Geralt, Is Molly a horse?
Morvran, Pardon?
Geralt," I did come here to see Molly, after all."
Louisa," Patience, witcher. She ought to arrive soon. I asked Molly to join"
Geralt," All depends what you asked her to do, m'lady. But I don't really have"
Morvran," Must say, I'm curious how you manage in the saddle, witcher."
Geralt, Mostly just try to stay in it.
Morvran, What would you say to a little race?
Geralt, Not what I came here for.
Morvran," Don't make me beg, witcher. Tell you what -- win, and I shall give you"
Geralt, Why not. Wouldn't mind seeing if your knowledge of horses translates
Morvran," Hah! Splendid. In that case, you must choose a mount."
Louisa," Well said. So, which steed do you choose, witcher?"
Geralt, Think I'll take the gray mare.
Geralt," The gray mare looks nimble. Besides, knew a man named Cahir once."
Geralt, I'll ride Nemrod. Pit a Nilfgaardian stallion against a
Geralt, The black's your favorite? Let's see what a Nilfgaardian
Geralt, Hmm... Redanian chestnut looks promising.
Geralt, Radovid's encamped nearby. Redanian chestnut might want to impress
Geralt, Think I'll give you a run on the Zerrikanian bay.
Geralt, Heard tales of Zerrikanian horses. I'll ride the bay.
Geralt, I'd rather resolve what I have to with Molly.
Morvran," Well, there she is. See the slim young woman? Resolve what you"
Morvran," Very well, I shan't insist. The attractive one -- that's Molly."
Louisa," I'll not ride with you, but I shall bet on a steed. Nemrod will win,"
Louisa," I'll not race, however I will wager on a winner. The gray mare's my"
Morvran," Cantarella for me, then. "
Morvran," In that case, I shall try my luck on the Zerrikanian bay."
Morvran, I see no point in delaying this. Let's begin.
Morvran, The horses are saddled. Let's begin.
Master," Riders, ready?!"
Louisa, What a thrill! A beautiful victory!
Geralt, Thanks.
Morvran," For one whom every horse is a Roach, you carry yourself exquisitely"
Geralt, The Roach I chose put in a nice run.
Morvran, Exceptional. I've not lost a race in a while. I congratulate you.
Louisa," Oof, so close!"
Geralt," The General's not only knowledgeable, but skilled. Congratulations."
Morvran, Thank you. It was a good race against a worthy opponent.
Morvran," Acknowledge it, witcher. I'm the superior rider."
Geralt, I'll acknowledge your Roach proved faster. Congratulations.
Morvran," Ah, look! Lady l'Attard has just arrived."
Geralt, Who?
Morvran, The woman formerly known as Molly. There she stands.
Geralt, Right... Thanks.
Morvran, I shall be here for a time. Find me if you'd like to ride back to
Geralt," Now, could I talk to your chambermaid, m'lady?"
Louisa," Ah! Yes, Molly. That is why you came for, after all. The portly young"
Morvran, Speak to her. And you must find us when you're ready to return to
Geralt," Who do you favor, m'lady?"
Molly, Can't decide between the black stallion and the gray mare. Keep goin'
Geralt, I'm Geralt.
Molly, Geralt? That Geralt? 
Molly," I'm Molly, m'lord. Wished to see me?"
Geralt, Call me Geralt.
Molly, Geralt? That Geralt? The one Dandelion's rescued time and time again?
Geralt, Mhm. Wouldn't be here if not for Dandelion.
Molly, Told me all about your adventures. How he'd ready you for battle with
Geralt, I meant that literally. Dandelion's why I'm here -- came to ask you
Geralt, That's right...except it's the other way around. I'm always saving
Molly, Mean to say it weren't Dandelion saved you in Flotsam by severin' your
Geralt," What? Dandelion couldn't... Er, never mind. Any idea where our master"
Molly," No...sadly, I haven't got a clue. We've not seen each other in ages."
Geralt, You do realize Dandelion doesn't have a sister.¹
Molly," Sure he does! Saw her meself! Funny, she don't look like him at all..."
Geralt," Mhm. Different mothers, too."
Molly," Maybe... But you could see he cared for her, looks after her, the way"
Geralt, Know where I can find her -- Dandelion's sister?
Molly," Oh no. Whenever I asked Dandelion when we'd visit her, he'd grow all"
Geralt," These packages... Any chance they were trunks, travel cases? And"
Molly," Yes, yes! Now I remember: she's a traveling performer, sailed in"
Geralt," Exceptionally. And very loving as well, I'm sure."
Molly," If you only knew! Dandelion even wrote a poem to her...""To My"
Geralt, Any chance you remember your last conversation with Dandelion?
Molly, Course! He came to borrow some coin for a barge...
Geralt, What? Why'd he need a barge?
Molly," To take me on a romantic cruise, of the canals, by the light of the"
Geralt, I'm under the impression Dandelion still thinks you serve the la
Molly," Oh, that's 'cause I never told him I stopped. Didn't want him to treat"
Geralt, And your husband has nothing against it...your old friendship?
Molly, Course not! Sweetiekins couldn't be happier that Dandelion's raisin'
Geralt," Thanks, Molly."
Molly, Wait...before you go...I've got a request. Dandelion told me once he'd
Geralt, Won't be too hard to convince him. He loves showing off those
Molly," Oh, that's wonderful! Thanks, and good luck to you on your search!"
Morvran," Ah, Geralt, there you are. Shall we return together?"
Geralt, Gladly. It's a long way to Novigrad. Road oughta seem shorter with
Morvran," I'd say the same. Well then, let's go."
Geralt, No. Actually came to say goodbye. I'll get back on my own somehow.
Morvran," As you will. In any case, I thank you for a pleasant afternoon."
Geralt," No, thank you. Till next time."
Morvran, And here we are. Thank you for your company.
Geralt, Likewise. See you.
Geralt, Excuse me. I'm looking for Marabella.
Marabella," I am she. Wait outside, class is in session."
Geralt," Sorry, can't wait. Here about Dandelion. I'm Geralt, and I'm--"
Marabella," Geralt? I know you. Fine, if you're eager to join the lesson,"
Geralt, I'll wait.
Marabella, It won't take long.
Kid, Yeah!
Kid, When's he gonna be here?
Marabella, It turns out he'll not come after all.
Kid, Why not?
Marabella," A rat bit him, and he's caught a fever."
Kid, Where'd he get bit?
Kid, It hurt 'im much?
Kid, Will he die?
Kid," You don't die from rats, stupid."
Kid," Yes you do. The other day I heard a witch hunter tell a man, ""You rat!"""
Kid, Liar!
Marabella, That's enough! We're done for the day. Gather your things and go
Geralt, Now can we talk?
Marabella, Yes. What do you want?
Marabella," Children, sadly the ratcatcher has a fever today, but in his stead"
Geralt, Uhh... But...
Kid, Yeah!
Kid, This is grand!
Marabella," You shan't disappoint them, will you? So, who would like to ask the"
Kid, Me! What's it mean that witchers are lech'rous?
Geralt, You shouldn't listen to everything people say about--
Kid, Means they go to sleep early.
Kid," Oh, so that's why mum went to tuck that witcher in!"
Geralt," It means that due to our mutations, we have an over developed libido."
Kid, Libby dough?
Kid," When a girl likes a witcher, the witcher says ""What'll you give me for"
says," ""Anythin' you want,"" so the witcher"
Kid, And that's where little witchers come from.
Geralt, Hmm...how old are you again?
Kid, Nine!
Geralt, Uuhh...
Kid, Eight!
Geralt," In that case, wait a few years and I'll tell you."
Marabella, Children! What's the meaning of this?! Next question.
Kid, Is it true witchers kill kings?
Geralt," A man cursed, who's turned into a monster, a witcher might have to"
Kid, So King Foltest was a monster?
Kid, What's it like to cut off someone's head?
Kid, Can you show us how to cut off a head?!
Kid, Can we try your potions?
Geralt, Don't believe everything they say about witchers...
Kid, What 'bout animals? They don't like you. My mum says animals don't like
Kid, Tomcat ever hiss at you?
Kid, You stoled many kids?
Geralt, No. It's not true.
Kid, He's a liar.
Kid," He ain't a liar, witchers don't lie."
Kid," They can lie because they're not knights. When you gotta kill a dragon,"
Marabella, Enough! That is all for today. Gather your things and I shall see
Kid, Yeah!
Marabella, Bid farewell to Master Geralt.
Kid, It's great you came.
Kid, Hmph. I'da rather had the ratcatcher...
Marabella, So please do tell me -- why are you here?
Geralt, Thanks. That was an ordeal. Think I'd rather face a swarm of nekkers
Marabella, The ratcatcher had no objections.
Geralt," Oh, yeah -- how's he feeling?"
Marabella," He's dead. Bubonic plague, it seems -- I didn't want to upset the"
Geralt, I know you saw Dandelion recently.
Marabella, Oh yes. Longest afternoon of my life.
Geralt, He read you his poems?
Marabella, No. We perused the Illustrated Guide to Fungi.
Geralt, Hmm... Maybe... Nope. Won't even try to guess why he wanted to do that.
Marabella, Mold -- that was his interest. When his hand abandoned him my knee
Geralt, See Dandelion after the...fungus incident?
Marabella, No. I even considered granting him another chance... His heart of
Geralt, Found a poem Dandelion wrote about you. Portrayed you as an unusually
Marabella, Really...? Did he mention my poetry? Horses have always fascinated
Geralt," Uhh... No, no, didn't see any."
Marabella," ""Gee-up! Her snakely whip rose skyward. Gee-haw! Crack! She reined"
Geralt," Sorry, don't know much about poetry..."
Geralt, Thanks for you help. Farewell.
Guard," Then, I chased the pansy all the way to the garden!"
Guard, Did you catch 'im?
Guard," No luck! Writhin' and slippery the bugger was, quick as a tomcat."
Guard, Sounds like he might've been an acrobat...
Guard, Maybe so. Both misses are fond of freaks...
Captain, What do you want?
Geralt, Rosa var Attre's expecting me. Supposed to give her lessons in
Captain, Come with me. Miss Rosa awaits.
Geralt, Wanna see Rosa var Attre.
Captain," Oh, mate, if you only knew what I want... Miss Rosa don't see just"
Geralt," I'm Geralt of Rivia, a witcher."
Captain," Soon as Miss Rosa turns into a striga, I'm sure her papa'll send for"
Geralt, I'm the new cook.
Captain," And them pointy things stickin' out behind you, they your cleavers?"
Guard," Away with you, vagrant."
Geralt, Nothing. Wrong house.
Man, ...you fancy men like me -- whole town's goin' on about it. So no point
Geralt," Uh, sorry to sneak in, miss. I'm Geralt, a friend of the bard"
Guard," What're you doin' here, vagrant?! Who let you in?! I let no one in the"
Captain, Hope you realize what you've gotten yourself into.
Geralt, Hope so too...
Captain, Miss Rosa's got a downright beastly temper. Shows no mercy once she
Rosa," You're my new instructor? Well, well, papa clearly went out of his way"
Rosa, I win! Is there not one competent instructor in this entire city?
Rosa, Well fought. You're much better than the last one.
Geralt, I'm not actually your swordplay instructor.
Rosa, Really? Then who are you? And how on earth did you get in?!
Geralt, Am I imagining things? Didn't we just have this conversation? In the
Rosa," The garden...? Yes, yes! In the garden. So, what was it you said? Why"
Geralt, Before I ask... Gotta admit -- you do pretty well with a sword. One
Rosa," Oh, I know, terrible habit. Can't seem to get rid of it. I'd hoped to"
Geralt, I'm a witcher. I'm looking f--
Rosa, A witcher! That's splendid! I always wanted to meet a witcher! This is
Geralt," Uh, what's so exciting about it?"
Rosa," Living on the edge, tracking, then facing down beasts, sleeping under"
Geralt," Mhm, try fighting a zeugl while up to your neck in sewage... Nothing"
Rosa," Not one of the high points, I suppose... Wait, weren't you about to"
Geralt, Incredibly. But we oughta discuss that another time.
Geralt," Came to ask about your rhetoric tutor, Dandelion."
Rosa," Rhetoric tutor? Good one. That is why papa hired him, but not at all"
Geralt, Mean he wasn't? But you had some sort of...relationship?
Rosa," If you call him chasing after me a relationship... Even so, there was"
Geralt, Guards aren't up to muster. Let me right in -- just had to tell them
Rosa, I told father they're a band of imbeciles! But if you're not the
Geralt," Neither, so whaddaya say we stay calm."
Rosa, But enough chatter! Stand and fight! I demand a rematch!
Rosa," Ha! I win! My, you really are a lousy swordsman. In fact, I believe I"
Geralt," Nice of you to offer, miss. Very. Afraid I have to say no."
Geralt, Not sure I can possibly pass up lessons from such a skilled young
Rosa," Well, if you're not an instructor, you should certainly be one. Fancy"
Geralt, Can't rightly refuse a request from a lady.
Geralt," Sorry, gotta say no. Schedule's packed just now."
Rosa, As you wish.
Edna, What are you two lovebirds whispering about?
Rosa," You asked about my relationship with Dandelion? Well, here's the mix-up's"
mastermind," Edna var Attre, the greatest mischief-maker north or south of"
Geralt, Hang on. So it was you in the garden.
Edna," Hahah, of course it was me. Why, did Rosa try to play you for a fool?"
Rosa, Don't be mad. We've done this since we were children. People have
Geralt," Sorry, you lost me..."
Rosa, You're not the first to be confused... I'll explain.
Geralt, Can someone please explain what this is all about? Which of you met
Rosa," No need to get angry, instructor. I'll explain."
Geralt, Take it Dandelion did too...?
Edna," On occasion, yes. But then Rosa would quickly set him straight."
Rosa," If you'd shut your catty mouth for a moment, dear little sister, I"
Geralt, Wait a minute: mean to say Dandelion mixed you two up?
Edna," On occasion, yes. But then Rosa would quickly set him straight."
Rosa," If you'd shut your catty mouth for a moment, dear little sister, I"
Rosa, Edna sent Dandelion some love letters. She signed my name. Conceited as
Edna," Rosa, I had the best intentions, you know that! I felt you needed help"
Rosa, He'll next sing at your funeral if you don't stop it right now!
Geralt," Calm down, ladies. No poet's worth worth two sisters nipping at each"
Rosa, Especially not this one...
Geralt, Quiet!
Edna," Ooh, now that's a mentor! Strong and decisive... Perhaps it's time I"
Geralt, Listen. I just wanna know one thing -- either of you seen Dandelion
Rosa, Edna might have. I certainly have not.
Edna," My dear sister, I would never spend time alone with the man for whom you"
Rosa, Burn with passion? For one who incessantly praises another woman's
Geralt, Who'd Dandelion sing about? Know anything about her?
Rosa, I believe she's a poetress or trobairitz... Very skilled and
Rosa," But who knows! The ""bard"" might've invented her just to make us"
Edna, I'd say it worked. You've gone all red in the face just talking about
Rosa, Your face'll be red when I scratch your eyes out!
Geralt," This woman -- not a local, right?"
Rosa," Hmm... I seem to remember him praising her ""melodious Koviri"
Edna," Makes sense -- he referred to her as ""Callonetta"" a few times."
Geralt, Gotta ask Zoltan about this Callonetta.
Geralt, Dandelion act any differently lately? Notice anything strange?
Rosa, Strange? Not really...
Edna," It's no use, Geralt. She's so enamored she'd hardly notice if he turned"
Rosa, Edna!
Edna, What? You needn't pretend he followed convention! Remember when he took
Geralt, Rhetoric lessons in a cemetery? Unusual even for Dandelion.
Edna, We set out to visit the graves of celebrated Oxenfurt professors. He
Geralt, Who?
Edna, Eccentric old coot. Died recently.
Rosa, He'd apparently been an important and generous patron of the arts as a
Geralt, Bet sophisticated young ladies like you know a bunch about politics.
Rosa, We've picked up a few things. What would you like to know?
Geralt, Changing subjects...
Geralt, Wonder how the war's going. Any outcome looming?
Edna," Papa says much depends on Radovid, and on who captures Novigrad first."
Geralt," What's Novigrad got to do with it? Free city -- never taken sides,"
Rosa," Oh, even children know Novigrad's home to the world's largest fleet."
Edna, And they say the city's treasury's bursting with enough to equip two
Geralt, Emperor continuing to push north. Courtiers must be ecstatic...
Edna, His confidants must be. But papa says that's not likely to last much
Geralt, Why not?
Rosa, Papa says the war's disrupting trade. And people are tired of
Geralt," Been a pleasure, but I've got stuff to take care of."
Edna, Exceedingly nice to meet you. Please come again.
Rosa, Well? Can I expect any more lessons in the future?
Geralt," Sorry, Rosa, afraid I can't at the moment."
Rosa," Farewell, then. Oh, payment for your time."
Geralt," Awfully convincing, miss. Wonder where you learned it. Name the time"
Rosa," How's here, tomorrow? Same time as today?"
Geralt, See you then.
Rosa," See you, master witcher."
Zoltan," How're you keepin', Poppy? Miss your Zoltan, you old bird? What's"
repeat, Savorrrry
Zoltan," Ah, you're back! You met Poppy? She ought to start talkin' any day now."
Geralt, That Field Marshal Duda's replacement? The marshal was a parrot --
Zoltan, At auction. Some mage's estate went under the hammer. Witch hunters
Geralt, How could you resist?
Zoltan," Couldn't. 'Tweren't possible. Ach, but Dandelion's what matters now."
Geralt," Zoltan, venture to say a mage would have trouble turning that owl"
Zoltan," Sure you know me that well? Mark my words, she'll be playin' gwent"
Geralt, Nice bird. But to the matter at hand.
Zoltan, So. How'd you do? Learn much?
Geralt, Women on my list hadn't seen Dandelion in a while. All claimed he'd
Zoltan," What's she supposedly like, this lass?"
Geralt," Blonde, from Kovir. A trobairitz, apparently. Named Callonetta or"
Geralt, Tell me what you've got first.
Zoltan," A few bruises and a torn doublet... Otherwise, no' much of note. He"
Geralt, Hmm... Think I might have something better.
Zoltan, What're you waitin' for? Let's have at it!
Geralt, Let's hear 'em. I'm all ears.
Zoltan," Ah, know how he wooed a lass studyin' natural history? Asked her"
Geralt, Maybe...or maybe he did all that for a reason.
Zoltan, Sounds like you've found somethin' out...
Zoltan," Ach, that makes it clear as crystal! It's Priscilla, aye -- must be"
Geralt, Who's this Priscilla?
Zoltan," A trobairitz, like you said. Quite popular of late. Picture Dandelion"
Geralt, Interesting image. So how'd Dandelion handle meeting his female
Zoltan, I think he fell in love.
Geralt, Why wasn't she on the list?
Zoltan," Hmm, this Priscilla was'ne like the others... Think Dandelion more'n"
Geralt, He lusts after every other woman he meets.
Zoltan, How can I explain...? Who does Dandelion love most?
Geralt, Himself.
Zoltan, Exactly. And she's his mirror image.
Geralt, What can I say -- could be he finally met his match.
Zoltan," She's his match, all right -- maybe more."
Geralt," Hm. Dandelion in love? Actually, truly in love?"
Zoltan," Ooh, yes."
Zoltan, The laddie's head's on fire! Lassy's got him whirlin'.
Geralt, All right. Guess we gotta talk to her.
Zoltan," Priscilla works with a mummers' troupe -- ""Renarde and the Foxen."""
Geralt, Meaning we've been sentenced to an evening of poetry?
Zoltan," Must ye always? This'll be true poetry, Geralt. You'll see."
Zoltan," Ah, here already! Come on, let's find some arse-rests. Should start"
Priscilla, These scars have long yearned for your tender caress.
Elsa, I know him! Twas¹ him murdered some Temerian boys back in White Orchard!
Man," Silence, woman. We've come to hear music."
Woman, A murderer?
Woman, There's a war on. Some die.
Man," Oh, please argue this out elsewhere."
Man, Squabbles and rows again! And I was told this was a decent establishment!
Zoltan," If I know Geralt, he risked his noggin to save someone else's arse!"
Elsa," Save, you say?! He murdered folk!"
Geralt, Don't let 'em provoke you.
Man, There's the door! Settle this outside!
Priscilla, Come.
Woman, I wish to listen to music! Music!
Man, Cultural capital of the world -- the fuck it is.
Zoltan," Permit me...to introduce...err... This here's Priscilla, known also as"
Priscilla," ...is Geralt of Rivia, I know. Dandelion's told me a great deal"
Geralt, There's a good reason I don't pour my heart out to bards -- they
Geralt," Seems Dandelion was meticulous in telling my story, down to personal"
Priscilla," Hahahahah! Splendid! Very funny, truly! So, see you later!"
Priscilla, Not here. Come with me.
Geralt, There a reason for all this sneaking around?
Priscilla," An excellent one... When last I saw Dandelion, he told me he was"
Zoltan, ...sheep dip...
Priscilla, ...And I've not seen him since.
Geralt, Lemme guess -- attempted heist was a failure?
Priscilla," Well he's not driven up in a gilded carriage laden with jewels,"
Geralt, Reuven... What's he like?
Zoltan, Tall... Fat... Dangerous as hell.
Priscilla, Limp in his gait -- left leg.
Geralt, Sounds like a lame rock troll.
Priscilla," If trolls were devilishly intelligent and had a flair for crime,"
Geralt, Dandelion breaking into a vault...I'd sooner expect him to choose a
Zoltan, True... Forgot to pay for his wine at the Passiflora once. He laid
Geralt, Any idea what got into him? He have debts he needed to pay off?
Priscilla, He claimed he was helping someone. An urgent matter that couldn't
Geralt," This ""someone"" -- Dandelion mention their name?"
Priscilla," No... But if I know Dandelion, it's ""her"" name he failed to"
Geralt, Whoreson Junior... Doesn't ring a bell.
Zoltan," Biggest prick in Novigrad. Not literally, but..."
Geralt, Got it. You're no fan. But what'd he do to you?
Priscilla, Try the whole town. He's one of four bosses who control the city's
Zoltan," The rascal... At least he didnae cross the Church as well, bring that"
Geralt," Here I go again, rushing to Dandelion's rescue... He oughta pay me"
Priscilla," Wherever he is, I sincerely doubt he's in the mood for jokes. Nor"
Geralt, Dammit... Hope Dandelion gets out of this alive...
Priscilla," And in one piece. Know what they do to bards? Break their fingers,"
Geralt," Relax, I'll get him out of this. Gotta talk to this Whoreson first --"
Zoltan," I don't know about Whoreson but Reuven runs a bathhouse. Careful,"
Geralt, So am I.
Priscilla, I don't doubt it...but Dandelion's not. I beg you to hurry. Let me

QUEST, IN CIRI'S FOOTSTEPS (NOVIGRAD) |_
Geralt, Anybody there?! Open up!
Voice, What's the fuss? The bathhouse is closed.
Geralt, Need to talk to the owner. I know he's here.
Voice," I'm not sure that matters, as he's terribly busy."
Geralt, Tell him Geralt of Rivia wants to talk to him.
Voice, I cannot promise Mr. Reuven will have time to see you.
Geralt, Wanna bet?
Geralt, Busy? With what?
Voice, Entertaining important guests.
Geralt," In that case, tell him there's another one at the door. Geralt of"
Voice," Teeheehee. Very well, I shall try. Please wait."
Happen, Sigi Reuven cordially invites you to join him. I'm Happen. The meeting
Geralt, Let's go.
Happen, You may disrobe here. Your equipment will be safe.
Happen, Splendid. Sigi Reuven awaits in the next room.
Varese," Whoreson got an invite, chose not to come. I'll show you what he thinks"
Reuven," Easy, Cleaver..."
Varese, Whoreson Junior's a dead man. I'll have my scribe send you a notice.
Bedlam," You don't have a scribe. And we'll eliminate Junior when, and only"
Bedlam, Reuven -- your guest.
Varese, Why the fuck you let him in here?
Reuven, Because I want to talk to him. This is Geralt of Rivia.
Bedlam, Good to see you again.
Varese, As always I'm out of the swivin' loop. Who the fuck are you?
Geralt, Think I'll let your host introduce me.
Reuven, He's a witcher. The very one who first foiled my attempt on Foltest's
Geralt," Allegedly. But I didn't kill Foltest. And hello to you, too,"
Reuven," Last we met, Geralt thrashed me silly and crushed my ankle. I really"
Geralt, I'm a witcher.
Varese, Problems with your plumbing?
Reuven, Nah. It's under control. Geralt's a friend from the old days.
Geralt," Got something to discuss with Dijkstra...I mean, Sigi Reuven."
Bedlam, I think it can wait.
Geralt," Yeah, probably can."
Geralt, None of your business.
Varese, Your friend got a death wish?
Reuven," Heheheh, nah, just short on manners. Witchers aren't exactly the"
Geralt, Got intruders. Someone just snuck inside the bathhouse. Several men...
Varese, What the fuck's he on about? Ploughin' fortuneteller.
Voice," Assassins! Please, no! Aaaaaa-!"
Varese," Bloody hell, I fucking knew it!"
Bedlam, Any weapons tucked away?
Reuven, Just a few.
Varese, First ever barney with my prick hangin' out. Harrr!
Assassin, Whoreson Junior sends his regards!
Reuven, We need one alive!
Bedlam," No one escapes, got it!"
Reuven," All right, come on."
Varese," Good work, gents."
Reuven, Terribly sorry for that incident. My security failed. I'll get to the
Varese, They were Whoreson's scum. That's the bottom of who and how right
Bedlam, Don't start that again. Especially not in front of our guest.
Varese, Who pranced in right before they attacked. Coincidence? Why do I doubt
Reuven, Let's give him a chance to explain.
Geralt, I'm looking for Whoreson Junior.
Bedlam, Interesting.
Varese, What do you want with him?
Geralt, It's personal.
Reuven," Hahaha, Geralt takes his privacy very seriously. Spyin' on him,"
Bedlam," Still, uh, he was lots more trusting when he was looking for"
Geralt, Junior's gonna help me find someone.
Bedlam, Whoreson's not helped a soul in all his miserable life.
Geralt, I'll ask him nicely.
Reuven," See, Cleaver? Perhaps if you'd not called Junior an uncle-fucker and"
Geralt, Not gonna introduce me to your friends?
Reuven, Good thing Happen's not here. He'd tan the hide on my arse for being
Varese," Gentlemen, you out of your fuckin' minds? A chat session? Whoreson's"
Geralt, Any clue on Junior's whereabouts? Be grateful for any lead.
Bedlam, Sigi?
Reuven, It's worth a try. Geralt's got a knack for finding people. And he's
Bedlam," Leave you to it, then."
Reuven," I'll, uh, look in on you tomorrow, Francis. Finish our talk."
Geralt, I need to find Whoreson. Now looks like I gotta get to him before
Reuven, Cleaver won't find him easy. Junior's good at hiding. He's got...
Bedlam," Look at the time. Good luck in your search, witcher."
Reuven," I'll call on you tomorrow, Francis. We'll finish our chat."
Geralt," So, how about we get dressed?"
Reuven," Sure, sure -- and then we'll talk. In private."
Reuven, Right mess that was... Never thought I'd be glad to see the man
Geralt," If you're any cleaner for it, gotta say it was worth breaking your"
Reuven, It healed poorly -- can you believe it? I must soak it in hot water
Geralt, Sorry to hear that.
Reuven," You're sorry? Well, consider it resolved, then. Now, mind showing me"
Geralt, I had my reasons. Your leg'd be fine if you hadn't gotten in my way.
Reuven," I see. Well, I promise you that if I could go back in time, I'd do"
Geralt," Listen, Reuven... No, Dijkstra -- just not in the mood for your code"
Reuven," Ah, what's the harm? Talk."
Geralt, Think Cleaver'll find Whoreson?
Reuven," He might, he might not. But he'll burn down half the city trying. What"
Geralt, Any ideas?
Reuven," Junior's got areas of the city where he's strong. Penetrate them, look"
Geralt," Hmm, makes sense to ask around, I guess... Junior might be in hiding,"
Reuven, Gambling -- that's his biggest earner. Junior controls the largest
Geralt, Where's Junior's casino?
Reuven, Near the Temple Watch towers... Whoreson's got nowt to do with the
Geralt, Arena sounds promising. Where's that?
Reuven," Sewers beneath Gildorf, but you'll have to enter through the Bits,"
Geralt, Mentioned Whoreson's got a house. Where is it?
Reuven," Solid townhouse on Temple Isle, just the other side of the bridge."
Geralt, See if I can't find Whoreson at the casino or the arena. Might talk
Reuven," Do what you will, just be cautious. Whoreson's expecting payback,"
Geralt," Thanks for your help, Dijkstra."
Reuven," Just go, witcher. And if you can't find the slimy bastard, come and"
Geralt, Pretty clear you and Bedlam don't want a war with Junior. Why?
Reuven, Let me tell you what I told King Vizimir time and time again: war
Geralt, Your partners aware of your past? They know you're Sigismund
Reuven," Heheh. Cleaver, Bedlam and Junior, well, I'd call them my partners"
Dwarf, We gots to make sure the pricklicker's not here.
Dwarf," Ach, I'd expect teeth to grow out me arse before I'd expect to find"
Dwarf," Cleaver said to be thorough, so we look everywhere."
Dwarf," Ought to burn the corpses, though. Else rats'll congregate to feast."
Guard, Why you even here?
Geralt," Same reason anyone comes here. Play a bit, have a good time."
Guard," Invite only, mate. Shit out of luck."
Geralt, Think we can make a deal?
Guard, Hear that? Another one.
Guard," No, we don't make deals."
Geralt, How much?
Guard, Oy. Remember what I told you? We're to be polite-like.
Guard," Just my patience -- runnin' a bit thin. We don't want your coin, we"
Guard," On your way, afore we get ploughin' angry, stop bein' all nice."
Geralt, Gonna get in there. Better for you to let me in.
Guard," And if we don't, then what?"
Geralt, I'll kill you.
Guard, D'you get that?
Guard," Got it, all right. He threatened us and reached for his weapon."
Guard," Die, you ploughin' bastard!"
Geralt, Here's my invite. All yours if you want it.
Guard," Yeah, gladly take it."
Guard," Incidentally, bloody useless, those crowns. In Temeria, you could say,"
Guard, That's true. What we got here -- some fuckin' ship? Ship couldn't
Guard, Downright stupid.
Guard," All right, you can go in."
Geralt, I think you're about to let me in.
Guard," By all means, please."
Geralt, And you...wish me luck.
Guard, Luck be with you at the tables.
Geralt, Tough luck. Fair enough.
Geralt, May I?
Dealer, Why not?
Geralt, Hankering to play. But I'm only interested in high stakes.
Dealer," I don't know you. Perhaps you have coin, perhaps not. Perhaps you can"
Geralt, Owner in? Something I gotta talk to him about.
Dealer, I'm all ears.
Geralt," Wanna talk to Whoreson Junior, not you."
Dealer, Bernie! Dusty! This one's looking for the boss! You have your
Geralt, It's all right. I'll look for a free table.
Dealer, Splendid idea. The gaming tables are upstairs.
Geralt, I'll come back later.
Dealer, As you wish.
cards, the first player...]
Geralt, Cards lining up today?
Player," A mutant? What the hell's a witcher doing here? See any drowned dead,"
Geralt, Nope. No monsters. Great opportunity to play cards.
Player," Clever man, eh? All right, we'll play, provided you've coin."
Geralt, I do.
Player, Fisstech? They've got the best powder in the city right here.
Geralt, Just wanna play.
Geralt, If you insist...
Player, I believe I will plough your arse like a cheap whore's...
Player," Hee hee hee! Took a beating, lad. But come back with coin, and"
Geralt, Sober up. Then we'll play.
Player, Hahah -- that never happens.
Geralt, Not hunting shitzards tonight. Looking for the owner of this
Player, Awww... Someone asked after him yesterday.
Geralt, Who?
Player," You know, I don't know. They crushed his head before I could get a"
Geralt, Really gotta talk to the owner. Know where I can find him?
Player, I don't know squat. But wait a moment... Gentlemen! This here rogue
Geralt, Thanks for the warning.
Player," Someone's nice to me, I try to be nice to them. At any rate, let's"
Geralt, Sober up. Then we'll play.
Player, Hahah -- that never happens.
Geralt, May I join you?
Player, I've never seen you here before.
Geralt, Heard Junior comes in here sometimes.
Player," Did you, now...? What else have you heard?"
Geralt, Whoreson around or not?
Player, Junior was right! Someone's after him! Disarm this man!
Geralt, Is that important?
Player, All who come here do so by either invitation or recommendation. Who
Geralt, Men at the door let me in. Not good enough?
Player, No. Preferable if someone vouched for you...soon. Until then -- I'll
Geralt, We done talking? I'd like to play.
Player," All right, take a seat."
Player, The luck! Hah! Jolly good hands!
Geralt, I noticed.
Player, I've a mind to let you win some back if you bring more coin.
Geralt, Changed my mind. Rather not sit down to a game right now.
Player, No one's compelling you. Return once you get the urge.
Geralt, The owner -- tell me where he is. Gotta talk to him.
Player," Oh my, you see... Junior's a dear friend. I spoke to him today."
Geralt," Never seen you here, either."
Player, You've clearly no notion who I am. Don't be clever with me. We don't
Geralt, Course you haven't. It's my first time here.
Player," This seat is taken. And anyway, high-stakes at this table."
Geralt, Got the coin for it.
Player, I couldn't care less if you've coin or not. What concerns me is how
Geralt, Cards being kind today?
Player, Matters little. I don't play plebs.
Geralt," Actually, I was knighted."
Player," Ahem. Indeed? Not to pry, good sir, but who bestowed the accolade?"
Geralt," Meve, Queen of Lyria and Rivia. During the Second War. Skirmish broke"
Player," The Battle for the Bridge? Oh, yes, heard of that. Ahem. Consider my"
Geralt," Nice place, isn't it?"
Player, Indeed. More the pity so much rabble comes here. Ahem. Sign of the

Geralt, Maybe I could have a word with him?
Player," A word of advice, friend. Never, ever ask after Junior. Even let you"
secret, I've been asked to inform whomever it concerns
Geralt, Forget I said anything.
Player," Ah, a reasonable man. And reason is man's most important virtue."
Geralt, Nowhere.
Player," Ahem, verily! Nice chat, dear chap. Now what about a game?"
Geralt, Wanna play?
Player, Naturally. Good luck to you!
Player," Beautiful game, ahem."
Geralt, Congratulations.
Player," I thank you. Naturally, you're entitled to a rematch."
Geralt, Not in the mood for cards. Maybe later.
Player," I shan't force you, but should you change your mind, I'll be"
Geralt, Don't have a choice. I gotta meet Whoreson Junior.
Player, Ah well. Gentlemen! This man is asking after the owner. Adamantly
Geralt," Beat you half to death... Hey, can you hear me? You alive?"
Rico, Don't...finish me...
Geralt, Don't intend to.
Rico, Who the hell are you? Heard screaming downstairs...
Geralt, It's all right now.
Rico, Will you help me?
Geralt, You're not hurt all that bad. Let's talk first. Why are you here?
Geralt, What's your name?
Rico, Rico. Rico Meiersdorf.
Geralt, Why're you here?
Rico," Eh, what's it look like? Came here to sit and think. All right, clever"
Geralt, Are you?
Rico, Well...kinda. Yeah.
Geralt," So, what have you...kinda...learned?"
Rico, Whoreson's working hand in glove with the Redanians. I don't know the
Geralt, Take care of yourself.
Rico, Thanks. I'll lay low until things settle down. Bedlam'll learn you
Geralt, Don't trust you an inch.
Rico," Told you all I know, I swear!"
Geralt, You'll have to stay a bit longer.
Rico," No, please... Think about it. It's not too late, hear me?!"
Geralt, Wonder if Dijkstra knows Junior's made a deal with the Redanians?
Guard, You hear? They raided Cleaver's house.
Guard, Don't be daft. Cleaver weren't born yesterday. War's on. Bugger kips
Guard, Hmph. Whoreson's in for it now. Cleaver's spiteful -- won't let it
Guard," Whoreson's gets ploughed up the arse, we'll be next, you know."
Guard," We had peace, peace was good. Who found it a fuckin' bother?"
Geralt, Greetings.
Guard, Don't know you. Not lettin' you in. And don't you fucking stand there.
Geralt, Recognize this piece of paper?
Guard, A fight contract.
Geralt," Good, you can read. So who's this contract made out to?"
Guard," Says, uh, Zdenek. Made out to Zdenek."
Geralt, Mhm. I'm Zdenek. Any more questions?
Guard, In you go.
Guard, Don't you go wanderin'. Straight to Igor now.
Geralt, Fair enough.
Geralt, Sure we can't work this out?
Guard, How's that?
Geralt," I pay you, you let me in."
Guard," Give it here. Get in. And remember, we've an eye on you."
Geralt, Who runs the fights?
Guard, Igor.
Guard," Down the corridor, then left."
Geralt, I want my chance in the arena.
Guard, Come in.
Geralt, Who's in charge?
Guard, Igor. They call him Hook.
Guard, What the bloody hell was that?
Geralt, A bout of sudden sincerity.
Geralt," Love to chat it up with doormen. In fact, often come to an agreement"
Guard," Oooh, hear the cockerel? Kickin' and standin' his comb on edge..."
Guard," Cock a doodle do, what am I to do? Shit myself?"
Geralt, All right...
Geralt, Fair enough.
Guard, Oi! Beat it!
Geralt, I need work.
Igor, What can you do?
Geralt, Good with a sword. Wouldn't scoff at working as protection.
Igor, And who here would you protect?
Geralt," Whoreson Junior's made a load of enemies, I know that much. Maybe I"
Igor," Junior can take care of himself, you needn't fret about him. But I"
Geralt," Heard it does, that's all."
Igor," Forget you heard of Junior, keep healthy. That's my advice."
Geralt," Not your hireling. Won't take your orders, don't need your advice."
Igor," You're not my hireling, that's true. But soooo uppity, afraid you need"
Geralt," Fine. All in all, don't really care who I'm gonna protect. Just"
Geralt, Crowds can spin out of control. Somebody's gotta keep the peace.
Igor, Hm... Claim any kind of experience?
Geralt, I'm a witcher. I kill monsters for coin. Been doing it all my life.
Igor, A guard must fight sometimes. But that's not most important. The
Geralt," Been taught how to slow down or speed up my heart rate, how to dilate"
Geralt, Done my share of fighting. Wouldn't carry a sword if I didn't know
Igor, Have you killed humans?
Geralt, Sometimes.
Igor, Why not come out and say you're a witcher? It's plain to see.
Geralt, Not looking for any monster contracts. Need a regular job. For a
Igor," Hmm... I'll have to test you. I want to see how you manage in a fight, if"
Geralt, Set me up.
Igor," Already have. Shall we start right away, or do you need time to"
Geralt, Always prepared.
Igor," Excellent! Let's see what you're worth. Remember, you fight to the"
Geralt, Let's do this.
Geralt, Need a moment to get ready.
Igor, Don't keep me waiting.
Geralt, Not about to slaughter people I don't even know.
Igor, No work in protection until I've made sure you are who you say you are.
Igor," Ready your purses! Betting is open! From the far east, where a man's"
Gustav, Don't kill me... Got kids... Three...
Geralt, I will not kill him!
Mob, Weakling! Let him die!
Gustav, Thre--three children...
Igor," The witcher wins! Next fight! Born brawlers in battle -- a fracas, a"
Geralt," Yield, or end like your brother."
Bro, Never!
Igor, • The witcher wins again!
Mob, Boo-oooo! More blood! More blood!
Igor, Want more? Release the beasts!
Mob, We want Bor-is! We want Bor-is!
Igor, Shall I release Boris?
Mob, Bor-is! Bor-is! Bor-is!
Igor," Especially for you, for the first time in a long time...release Boris!"
Igor, Yet another win for the witcher!
Junior, Bravo! Ploughin' scragged 'em up thorough. They told me a true
Geralt, Thanks. I'd like to know who's congratulating me.
Junior," Heheh, slow, ain't ya? Came here to end me, and you've no notion"
Geralt, Thanks.
Junior," Cyprian Wily, known to most as Whoreson Junior, appreciates good"
Junior," Well, we've nattered enough. Now--"
Igor, Cleaver's dwarves are in the sewers! They've slaughtered the guards!
Junior, Don't stand there like a soddin' prick at a wedding! Muster the men
Igor, You heard the man. Kill him!
Geralt, Should search this hole.
Geralt, Floor's worn by a moving door -- something behind this wall.
Geralt," Wily, Whoreson Junior -- he's working with Radovid."
Reuven," Huh. If this is reliable information, Whoreson's neck-deep in shit."
Geralt, Source seems reliable.
Reuven, Hm. It would certainly explain how he had the nerve to break with
Geralt, You fallen out with Redania?
Reuven, My sympathies have nowt to do with it. Whoreson wiped his arse with
Geralt, Need someone who can get me in to see Junior. You must still have some
Reuven, I don't... But you do.
Geralt, Enlighten me.
Reuven, Temarian... Former commander of the Blue Stripes... Ring a bell?
Geralt, Vernon Roche.
Reuven, He's holed up with his men in a camp near Oxenfurt. Pay him a visit.
Geralt, Lookin' for Roche.
Sentry, No one here by that name. Anythin' else?
Geralt, I see. And behind you -- that's a berry pickers' camp?
Sentry," We're, uh...birdwatchers."
Geralt, Lemme guess: that sword's in case you run into a hornbill?
Sentry," No. Hornbills aren't endemic to this area. Don't migrate here,"
Geralt, Move.
Sentry," No, sorry. We talked, it was amusin', now about face and forward"
Geralt, Gonna walk in the camp now.
Sentry," Aye, naturally."
Geralt, And you're gonna go look for hornbills.
Sentry," Aye, I'm goin', indeed."
Geralt, I get it. You're the local funny man.
Sentry, What was that? Funny? How you mean that?
Sentry," Gray old vagrant, but you got a fist of stone."
Vernon," You blind, Hortensio? That's Geralt, old friend of mine. Come in,"
Vernon, Geralt of Rivia. Safe and sound.
Geralt, Vernon Roche. Temeria's last hope.
Vernon, Laugh all you want. Temeria will rise again.
Ves," Roche, I cannot abandon them. I--"
Vernon, You can and must. Because those are your orders.
Ves, They'll die. Please.
Vernon, We're done. Dismissed.
Geralt, Looking for Whoreson Junior.
Vernon, I've heard of him. Though I'm not sure why you think he might be in
Geralt, Heard some birds chirping. You've got some of the same friends. Both
Vernon," These birds, they're terribly talkative. I'll need to see them,"
Geralt," Mhm. Meantime, Vernon, willing to help, or do I need to keep looking?"
Vernon," Hmm. As always, you've more luck than you deserve. I'm on my way to"
Geralt, Thanks. Knew I could count on you.
Geralt, What do you do here? Hunt Scoia'tael?
Vernon," You jest, right? Who cares about the Scoia'tael anymore.¹ Temeria --"
Geralt, How'd you wind up here?
Vernon," Came with the army, of course. Its remnants. When Nilfgaard crossed"
Geralt, But?
Vernon, But Radovid proved no better than Emhyr. So I decided I would mount
Geralt, So long.
Vernon, My contact should be here.
Geralt, Ready?
Vernon, My contact awaits at the chess club. Let's get this over with.
Geralt, Come on.
Geralt, Your contact -- who is it?
Vernon, Slippery little bugger. I'd have nothing to do with him were the
Geralt, Mean you don't trust him?
Vernon, I trust no one. Including you.
Vernon, Something's not right.
Geralt, Let's see what.
Radovid, Checkmate.
Radovid, They say it's the game of kings. That chess teaches one to think
Geralt, For...practice? To hone your thinking?
Radovid, No.
Geralt, To kill time?
Radovid," I have no time to squander, let alone kill."
Geralt, To spend time in good company?
Radovid, A king cherishes no one's company.
Geralt, I have no idea.
Radovid, I play chess to reveal the game's secret. Blood thumps inside these
Geralt," Yes, Sire, I believe I do."
Radovid, You know shit. You're merely humoring me. I was not speaking
truth, a monarch is always surrounded by
Geralt," No, I don't."
Radovid, You do not because you are not a king. Pawns see only their comrades
Radovid, • Understand?
Geralt, I think I do now.
Geralt," No, still don't get it."
Radovid, Unimportant... Let us speak. Why have you brought the witcher here?
Vernon, I think he'd best explain.
Geralt," I'm looking for Cyprian Wily, Whoreson Junior. I know Redania"
Radovid, Why do you seek him?
Geralt, It's personal.
Radovid, Fair enough. I'll not pry.
Geralt, Expected a Redanian spy. Had no idea we'd be meeting a king.
Radovid," When you've an opportunity to omit intermediaries, I'd suggest you"
Radovid, I've placed Junior in a mansion in Oxenfurt. Very few know this.
Geralt, You'd just give me a man? After investing coin and time in him? Can't
Radovid, Consider it a gesture of goodwill...almost. I'll expect you to
Geralt," I appreciate the gesture, Your Majesty."
Radovid," A king should be severe towards his foes, generous to his friends."
Radovid," And also, Junior has lost his purpose. The Big Four is no more. I"
Vernon," Radovid's sinking ever deeper into madness, as I see it."
Geralt, I know where to find Junior. Don't really care beyond that.
Vernon," Geralt. Come to think of it, I too wanted to ask a favor. I've a"
Geralt," Let me think about it. See you, Roche."
Guard, Whores only ever go in. Not one's comes out!
Guard, Boss's got a voracious appetite. I hear 'em squealing like sows bein'
Guard," Ah, I could do with a little fleshy diversion myself."
Guard," Mhm, yeah..."
Guard, What do you want?
Geralt, Where's Whoreson Junior?
Guard," Ooh, this one's got bollocks, don't he?"
Guard," I know you, you motherfucker. Saw you kill Olgard and Vick."
Geralt," Uh, must be a misunderstanding."
Guard, Flank the bastard!
Geralt, Believe I did have the pleasure to meet those two gentlemen. What
Geralt," Fucking degenerate. He so much as touched Ciri, he'll pay."
Junior, What the sandwich fuck is this?
Junior," Oh fuck me... Help me, for fuck's sake!"
Geralt, No one's coming.
Junior, Oomph! Stop... What... What do you want?
Geralt," Hello, Junior. Been looking for you a while now. I've come to kill"
Junior, I'll give you all I got...
Geralt," Hello, Junior. I've come to talk."
Junior, I'll do whatever you want...
Geralt, Got a few questions to start with.
Junior, I'll tell you everything...
Geralt, I'm looking for a young woman and a minstrel. I know you've met them.
Junior, A bird? What fucking b--?
Geralt, Ashen-haired with a sword on her back. Just like me.
Junior," Yes, yes... Her, that was... I remember..."
Geralt," I'd like to know how the ashen-haired woman ended up meeting you, and"
Junior, What happened to her? She attacked me!
Geralt," Lie one more time, and I'll cut your balls off."
Junior, Heheheh... We'd made a deal. I was to repair their magic
Geralt, What did you do?
Junior," I nabbed their flunky, Dodo, and waited for them to come for him."
Geralt, Pay attention now. You'll tell the truth. Wanna know why?
Junior," I won't lie, honest!"
Geralt, Took me a long time to find you. Wasn't an easy road to travel. I'm
Junior, Yes...
Geralt, Good.
Geralt, A phylactery? You can fix something like this?
Junior, Not me. I know a guy...
Geralt," Wasting my time, Junior. I need details."
Junior," I'll tell you, tell you all! Just the way it happened..."
Story," Visiting Junior"" begins at this point -- see the section for"
Junior, That's what happened. Told you true.
Geralt, What happened to the woman?
Junior, Fuck if I know... One of the boys -- got her in the back... But she's
Geralt, Got anything else to say?
Junior, I've told you all I know! Everything...
Geralt, Dudu -- what happened to him?
Junior," I don't fucking know... Prick vanished! There one moment, gone the"
Geralt, You hurt the woman I'm looking for... You tortured her friend.
Junior, She attacked me! I've a right to defend myself! I beg you... Got what
Geralt," Lemme tell you where things stand. I'm looking for this woman, 'cause"
Junior, Noooo!
Geralt, I'm no executioner.
Junior," Thank you... I'll make it up to you, I will... This is my city, and--"
Geralt, Shut up. Know what? Gotta wonder what your friends from the Big
Junior, Hey! Wait! What're you saying? Waaait!
Sentry, Seems you've resolved your matters. It's time you returned the favor.
Geralt," Radovid doesn't like to wait much, does he?"
Sentry," No, he does not. You'll come with us."
Sentry," The HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor, once the crown jewel of the Redanian fleet."
Geralt, Nice boat.
Sentry, You'll need to leave your weapons if I'm to let you aboard. Follow me.
Sentry, Ship was funded with donations. From noblewomen. Ladies from the most
Geralt," A spur-of-the-moment, patriotic impulse?"
Sentry, You're a homeless wanderer. Can't understand what it is to truly love
Radovid, There you are.
Geralt," Need something from me, Your Majesty?"
Radovid, You've never been one to mince words. Very well. Find Philippa Eilhart
Geralt, Need to think about it.
Radovid, Don't take too long. We wouldn't want Philippa to escape...again.
Geralt, Philippa's using magic? You'd be better off sending mages after her.
Radovid, I agreed to the Conclave's revival -- but what has this brought me?
Geralt, There's always your witch hunters.
Radovid, You are the best witch hunter. You've proven it clearly. Síle de
Geralt, Philippa Eilhart. What's she looking for here?
Radovid," I suspect she wants to find her old friends, reconvene the Lodge."
Sentry, Your arms.
Geralt, Thanks.
Sentry," Never seen better steel in my life. Blade must strike true, no?"
Geralt," It's a matter of the hand, not the steel it's holding."
Geralt," Listen, I tracked down Whoreson Junior."
Priscilla, Yes? And? Did you learn somethin'?
Geralt, Yeah. Ciri and Dandelion set out to steal Sigi Reuven's treasure for
Priscilla," I can't believe she parleyed with that bastard! Why, it's widely"
Geralt," Ciri was desperate. But you're right, it wasn't the best idea. Whoreson"
Priscilla, Dudu? Well... Ho--how is Dudu related to this in any way?
Geralt," Seems Dandelion got him involved, to help Ciri. Luckily, Dudu managed"
Priscilla, Ooh... What of Wily?
Geralt, He's dead.
Geralt," I'd expect him to lay low, not do any business for some time."
Priscilla, Certainly hope you're right. Though his type never forgives and

Ciri," Cheer up. We'll manage this, I'm certain."
Dandelion," Famous last words, right there."
Ciri," Get a grip, Dandelion. We must focus on the task at hand."
Dandelion, I'm just saying...
Ciri, Well then be silent.
Ciri, Have you learned where Whoreson is keeping Dudu?
Dandelion, Room on the top floor. One with the balcony.
Ciri, I'll need to cross onto the roof. Wait for me in front of Junior's house.
Dandelion, If they... If they hurt you... Whoreson will pay.
Ciri, Must climb onto the roof.
Ciri, Room on the top floor. One with a balcony. There's the balcony. Let's

QUEST, IN CIRI'S FOOTSTEPS (NOVIGRAD) |_
Geralt, Listen -- Dandelion's missing. Any idea what might've happened to him?
Reuven, Same thing that happens to anyone who steps on Junior's toes...
Geralt, Meaning?
Reuven, He's surrounded by splendid virgins who ply him with sparkling wine
Geralt, Lute.
Reuven, Far as I'm concerned he might as well be rotting down there with a

Geralt," You got me... Need work, thought you might throw some my way. Monster"
Reuven," Yeah... Might be able to help me, in fact."
Geralt," You wouldn't happen to have a bone to pick with Dandelion, would you?"
Reuven, Course I do.
Geralt, You serious?
Reuven, Dead serious... Dandelion published a sonnet recently. Second stanza
Geralt, I was being serious.
Reuven, As am I when I say I have no time to worry about your gigolo
Geralt, Maybe I can help... What do you need?
Reuven, I'd rather show than tell. Picture's worth a thousand words and all
Geralt, Figured as much.
Reuven," Excellent. One last request... Oh, let's call it what it is -- a"
Geralt," I'll get paid on top of that, right?"
Reuven," Nothing for free, eh? Did you bargain this hard when Emhyr wanted"
Geralt, No idea what you're talking about.
Reuven, You are the worst liar I've ever known... Glad I don't need you to
Geralt, Who told you?
Reuven," What do you mean ""who""? Emhyr did."
Geralt, Hahah.
Reuven," I could never reveal my sources, to you or anyone else. It would be"
Geralt, Don't have time right now.
Reuven, Then come back when you do.
Geralt, You in contact with Radovid?
Reuven," Hahahaha. See you're witty as ever. No, I'm not in contact with him"
Geralt, Never quite forgave you for conspiring with Philippa Eilhart?
Reuven, Radovid doesn't forgive. Not anything. Not anyone. And especially not
Geralt, Philippa Eilhart -- had any news?
Reuven, Just good.
Geralt, Meaning?
Reuven," After Radovid popped her eyes out, she disappeared without a trace."
Geralt, Thought you two were close...
Reuven, We were. Until Philippa sent assassins after me.
Geralt, From mastery spy to master criminal... Interesting progression.
Reuven, Why? Truth be told they're awfully similar. Both about maintaining a
Geralt, Yeah... Except you used to do that in the name of some ideal. And now?
Reuven, Now I've decided I've slaved enough for ideals. It's time I worked for
Geralt, Time I was on my way.
Reuven, Got things to do myself. So long!
Reuven, Be so kind as to follow me.
Reuven," Oh, Bart! Not again!"
Geralt, ...Bart?
Reuven, Bart! Stop that! Now!
Bart, Bart bad... Bart make Sigi lose chorfun.
Reuven, Beating your head against the wall won't change that.
Bart," Bart hurt, Bart less thinky. Bart less thinky, Bart sadless."
Geralt, Don't seem to have trouble communicating with the troll.. Why'd you
Reuven, Take note of that hole. We'll come back to it later.
Geralt, Where'd you get the troll?
Reuven, From Zerrikania. Won him. Card game with a camel merchant.
Geralt, Your jokes are getting better by the minute.
Reuven, See me smiling? I'm dead serious.
Bart, Bart eye bumpy horses. Hot there. Sigi Bart take. Good Sigi.
Reuven, And see that door? Vault behind it -- until recently filled with
Bart, Bart guard! Then boom! Chorfun go.
Reuven," Translating into Common, someone fuckin' made off with nearly twenty"
Geralt, Fine. I'll help you.
Reuven, You're not exactly bursting with enthusiasm.
Geralt, Witcher mutations. They strip us of emotion. I'd be jumping for joy
Geralt, Why don't you handle this? Gotta have connections in the underworld.
Reuven," Agh. The gold wasn't mine alone. See, I run a members-only savings"
Geralt, How do you know you can trust me?
Reuven," I don't... Counting on your survival instinct. Slip up, and I'll kill"
Bart, Bart sorry. Bart job that got.
Geralt," It's a tall order, Dijkstra. Need to think it over."
Reuven, Fine. Just remember...what you saw here -- mum's the word. That's
Geralt, Understood.
Reuven, Excellent.
Geralt, All right. Oughta look around. But first -- some questions.
Reuven, I'm all ears.
Geralt, Take it the thieves got in through the hole behind you?
Reuven, You're a regular fucking master sleuth. Any other brilliant
Geralt," No. But I am wondering, for instance, how that hole got there..."
Geralt, Anyone see what happened?
Reuven, Other than Bart? No. And the vault's location is known only to the
Geralt, What about upstairs? Anything unusual happen in the bathhouse the day
Reuven," No. Happen swears it was calm as ever. The usual customers, no"
Geralt, How much was it all worth? Got an approximate idea?
Reuven, Why the fuck do you care? Figuring your finder's fee? Don't get your
Geralt, Know you too well for that... Just prefer to know what I'm looking
Reuven," Three crates of Nilfgaardian florens, a chest of emeralds, rubies,"
Bart, Shiny chorfun... All gone.
Bart," Hole no. Boom! Hole. Bart want look go... Bart look no, only sleep. Bad"
Geralt, Boom? Can you elaborate?
Bart, Boom... Big... Er...this like.
Reuven, I'll elaborate. Explosion -- big enough to blow that fucking hole in
Geralt, Gotten pretty good at communicating with this troll...
Reuven, Lots of prior experience -- worked with idiots my whole life.
Geralt, Bad mushrooms -- what's that about?
Reuven, Pops mold. The spores are highly toxic -- one whiff and you're dead.
Bart, Yes... Bart. Bart troll...
Reuven," Not talking to you, dimwit. Where was I? Ah, mold spores. They cover"
Geralt," Bart, you see them?"
Bart," Bart through hole, want see boom got what. Breath 'shroom. Sleep go."
Reuven," Now, now. Stiff upper lip..."
Geralt, Try to track down the thief yourself?
Reuven," Of course. Hired this lummox, Fonce -- thick enough not to ask"
Geralt, What happened?
Reuven," Lad started belchin' something horrendous -- I mean, burps with so"
Geralt, Should look around the sewers. Got any more of that pops antidote?
Reuven," I've a few vials left. Got the formula, too. Disgusting swill, to be"
Geralt, Thanks.
Reuven, You've naught to thank me for -- literally. You're no good to me if
Geralt," Mind describing this ""something"" that crawled out of the water?"
Reuven," No. Doesn't mean I can, though. Air in the sewer's thick with"
Geralt, Musta noticed something. Was it...?
Reuven," No, didn't notice a fucking thing. Didn't do a taxonomic field"
Reuven," Listen, I'll be upstairs if you need me. Sight of this empty vault's"
Geralt, Dandelion... What the hell have you gotten yourself into...
Geralt, Ugh... And I thought witcher's potions were vile...
Geralt, That'd be it down here. Time to see Dijkstra.
Geralt, Done. Examined every nook of the sewers near your vault.
Reuven, Well? Learn anything?
Geralt, Seems to me a bomb blew the wall open. Look.
Reuven," Bottom of a silver cylinder, probably. Covered in runes..."
Geralt, Recognized some ingredients by their scent -- wyvern oil and sugar.
Reuven," Sugar?! Geralt, I'm in no mood for jests."
Geralt, Nor am I. Just saying what I found -- bomb contained sugar.
Geralt," Guess I could be wrong. Smell was weak, barely detectable."
Geralt," Found a second corpse -- one of the thieves. Threw up the antidote,"
Reuven, A beautiful death. Find anything on the body?
Geralt, Not much. Empty vial.
Reuven, Hmm... Wouldn't have left him behind if he was anybody. Common
Geralt, Bits of the treasure dropped out of the crates. Left a clear trail.
Reuven," Mhm, I know the one. Hansel, Gretel, burning witches. Very fitting"
Geralt, Trail leads to the river where the sewer lets out... Breaks off
Reuven," Yeah, a cart drawn by sewer rats does seem unlikely. And since boats"
Reuven, Let's think... Sugar would react violently with sulfuric acid... But
Geralt, Didn't know you were versed in alchemy.
Reuven, Dabbled in it a bit while at Oxenfurt Academy... But this is no time to
Geralt, Bomb went off inside a drainage pipe embedded in the vault wall.
Reuven, The bomb must have found its way into the pipe from inside the
Geralt, Exactly. Mighta gone something like this: perpetrator started
Reuven," The bomb flowed down with the run-off, came to rest on the grate"
Geralt, Drain pipe's our only promising lead. We just need to know which
Reuven," Yes... Happen keeps a record of guests, should be able to tell us"
Geralt, Feel honored to be acknowledged.
Reuven," Oh, that famous sarcasm... I'd missed it."
Geralt, Really?
Reuven, Mhm. About as much as I'd miss a knife in my knickers.
Reuven," All right. You inspect the pools on the right, I'll take the ones on"
Geralt, Nothing interesting.
Geralt," Something floating on the surface... Oil, looks like..."
Geralt, Silver lid... Matches the cylinder bottom I found in the sewer...
Reuven, Got something?
Geralt, Yeah. Bomb part.
Reuven, Happen! Drain pool four! And bring me the guest book! Chop-chop!
Geralt, Let's see what's on the bottom...
Geralt, By the way... What about Happen? Could've overheard you mention the
Reuven," Happen has numerous flaws. He's pompous, pretentious, can be a real"
Geralt, How can you be so sure?
Reuven," Witchers know their monsters, spies know their men."
Geralt," You trusted Philippa Eilhart once, too..."
Reuven, True. But I didn't pull Philippa Eilhart out of a Kovir prison the
Geralt," Grate's been removed from the drain, meaning they flushed the bomb down"
Reuven, Happen! Who used this pool the day of the break-in?
Happen," Let me see... Berthold Heintz -- town councilman, Josef Schveik --"
Reuven, Henckel? That's impossible!
Geralt, Margrave Henckel? Who's that?
Reuven," Who was that, you mean!"
Geralt, Impossible? Why?
Reuven, Old coot's been eating dirt since last winter! Couldn't have been here
Happen, He's dead? I'd not heard...
Reuven," Not surprisin'. The honorable margrave croaked in a brothel, decked"
Happen," Yet... Yet I saw him that fateful day, Mr. Reuven. I'm certain of it."
Reuven, Did you speak to him? Get a good look at him?
Happen, No... He merely passed by on the way in...
Reuven, So you didn't see Henckel -- you saw an impersonator! Think for once!
Geralt, Gotta ask me nicely. I'm not one of your delivery boys.
Reuven, Pardon my tone. I've grown accustomed to ordering folk around and
Geralt, Fine. Where should I start?
Reuven, Henckel's home -- derelict townhouse south of the main square. You
Geralt, What a dump. Looks more like a beggar's hovel than a margrave's
Geralt," 1245 to 1254... Hm. Satisfying click...in the next room over, I think."
Geralt, Secret room... Probably where Dandelion and his cohorts planned the

Geralt, Dijkstra...and Triss? Didn't expect to see you here... Certainly not
Reuven, I decided we could use someone who knows a bit of magic. The runes on
Geralt," You dying to know too, Triss?"
Triss, No. Just here for the coin.
Reuven," Ah, Merigold playing the cynical materialist. I like it. In truth, her"
Geralt, Bothered Triss for nothing. No point examining the bomb.
Reuven, Because?
Geralt, Cause¹ I already know who nabbed your treasure. Commander of the

Geralt, Hang on. Gotta tell me why you're here first. We agreed -- if I
Reuven, So we did... But I was concerned about you. Stopped by to see if
Geralt, Bullshit. You don't trust me.
Reuven," I trust you as much as you trust me -- not at all. Believe me, it's"
Geralt," Thanks. You can breathe easy now. In the future, though, remember"
Reuven," Fine. You look after yourself, and I'll look after my interests."
Triss, Gentlemen... Really privileged to witness your battle of wits...but
Reuven," Geralt, would you be king enough to tell me what you've learned? I'm"
Geralt, Henckel told me. Old man's alive and well -- faked his own death to
Reuven, Strange... I had no idea he was in debt.
Geralt, He was. And Menge promised to take care of things in exchange for
Reuven," Geralt, how can I put this delicately... Bollocks. If you thought I'd"
Geralt," All right, I lied... But only partly."
Reuven," Heard of beasts that are half-lion, half-eagle, maidens who are"
Geralt, I'll give it a shot anyway. Didn't actually see Henckel -- but Menge
Reuven, Take it you learned this by peering into a crystal ball?
Geralt, Maybe. Trade secret.
Geralt, Know you well enough to know what matters: results... So I lied.
Reuven," Forgive me, Geralt... But after what you just pulled, I'd sooner"
Triss, Would you believe a sorceress who stands to gain if you get your coin
Reuven," Perhaps... I'd still prefer the whore, though."
Reuven, You're hidin' somethin'. And that's one thing I can't stand. Even
Geralt, What I've learned doesn't matter.
Reuven, Doesn't matter?! Yet you agreed to help me.
Geralt, I am. Doesn't mean I have to confess everything.
Reuven, I'll let your insolence fly this time -- but only because his honor
Reuven," Hm, Menge has been spending heaps of coin lately, though to my"
Triss, So. What now?
Reuven," From what I've heard, Menge spends his nights at the docks, witch"
Geralt, Doubt Menge'll say anything willingly...
Reuven, As do I. Luckily I hired a witcher and a sorceresss who've been
Triss, What's our past got to do with it?
Reuven, A great deal. Lovers will jump into the abyss for one another...
Geralt, Information's out of date. We are not...

Triss, First. First love. Now how the hell...?
Reuven," Mha, now that's my secret, lovebirds... Really must be going. Good"
Geralt," In other words, you're using us."
Reuven, Using you? Never! Merely makin' the most of your mutual bond.
Geralt, Mhm. So we do your dirty work while you sit around twiddling your

Geralt," And safe... Come on, admit you're scared of Menge."
Reuven, Of course I'm scared... Bloody dangerous whoreson. Triss would
Triss, Not in those words... But I do agree with the statement overall.
Triss, • Didn't have to disagree so...strongly...
Geralt, Dijkstra doesn't need to know about my love life.
Triss, Wise... I'd never choose his shoulder to cry on either.
Geralt, Put yourself in my shoes. What would you have said?
Triss," In your shoes, I wouldn't be worrying about what to say to Dijkstra."
Geralt, Could've corrected him yourself.
Triss," True... But it's not an easy thing to say, is it?"
Geralt," Sorry, didn't mean to hurt your feelings..."
Triss, Hope not.
Triss, But we've strayed from our topic... Got a treasure to recover.
Geralt," Triss, gotta tell you something... Dijkstra's gold -- it's the last"
Triss," Thought as much... This is about Ciri, isn't it?"
Geralt, Mhm. Menge's got Dandelion locked up somewhere... And Dandelion saw
Triss," That changes everything. Listen, meet me at midnight by the chapel of"
Geralt, All right. See you then... And thanks.
Triss, Glad you're here. Listen... Took a look at the building and it does not
Geralt, Mean it could use a bit of paint and spackle?
Triss," I mean it's a damned fortress. High walls, guards at the gate, armed men"
Geralt, What do you suggest?
Triss, Take these shackles... Put them on me.
Geralt, Mind explaining what all this is about?
Geralt," Uh, Triss... Sure you want to do this? Out here? With everyone"
Triss," This might come as a surprise to you, but shackles do have their uses"
Triss," Think... Bring the hunters the vile Triss Merigold, they won't just open"
Geralt, No way. Too risky.
Triss, Dandelion's life is on the line...Ciri's too. No such thing as too
Geralt," Fine, let's say they take the bait... What then? We go in, I put a"
Triss," Might not work. Menge's scum, but you have to admit... Death doesn't"
Geralt, Always found that annoying in fanatics.
Geralt," Triss, think about it... Really want to walk into the lion's den of"
Triss, Yes.
Geralt, No. Can't allow it.
Triss," Nice of you to worry... But I've made my decision, and I won't change"
Geralt, So we gotta trick him into talking. Any ideas?
Triss, Uh... Maybe tell him you have information about the Lodge -- or about
Geralt, Still got a bad feeling about this... But tough. Let's go.
Geralt, Wait. I wanna thank you.
Triss, Come on. Anyone would do this...
Geralt, No. Not anyone.
Triss, Stop. It doesn't befit a sorceress to blush.
Geralt, What about the treasure?
Triss," If we learn anything, great. If not..."
Geralt, Thought you need coin from Dijkstra to help the other mages.
Triss," True, I do... Lots of ways to get gold, though. It's just not the most"
Triss," Geralt, remember, I can take care of myself."
Geralt, What're you talking about?
Triss, The hunters... They won't treat me like a lady. But I'll survive. Might
Geralt, Can't promise that.
Triss, I'm still asking you to. All right?
Geralt, All right.
Sentry, Whaddaya want?
Geralt, Here for my reward!
Sentry, What the hell for?
Geralt, For a witch! Recognize who I got? It's Triss Merigold!
Sentry," Merigold?! Come in, then!"
Hunter," Well, well... Triss Merigold. Given up drowners for sorceresses?"
Geralt, Pay's better.
Hunter, It's 'cause they do more harm. What's a drowner do? Pull the odd
Triss, Don't forget turning your cows' milk sour straight out of the udder.
Triss, Aaaah!
Hunter," You're done jesting, Merigold. For good. Put her in a cell."
Geralt, Not so fast. I hand her over to Menge himself -- or not at all.
Hunter, You reckon we don't what to do with this witch?
Triss," Let go, you bastard."
Hunter, Vulgar tongue's got no place bein' in such a pretty mouth. I guess
Geralt," Try to loosen it, if I were you. Might learn something interesting."
Hunter, For instance?
Geralt," For instance, where Philippa Eilhart's hiding."
Triss," I'll get you for this, you..."
Geralt," Yeah -- you might know how to handle witches, when they're brought"
Hunter, What's that supposed to mean?
Geralt, That you're crap witch hunters if a witcher's gotta do your hunting
Hunter," Listen here, mutant... Since we entered this town, we've made ashes"
Geralt," Actually, think I could tell you a thing or two... It's not just"
Triss," I'll get you for this, you..."
Hunter," Shut your gob, ginger whore! And you spit it out -- where's"
Geralt, Thought I made myself clear -- I'll only talk to Menge.
Hunter, Menge don't talk to the likes of you.
Geralt, Well then you be sure and tell him I came by. With my friend
Hunter, Fine... Grab her and come with me. But be sure to stay right
Geralt, Don't talk to her that way.
Hunter," Why not? She's a whore, ain't she?"
Geralt," Maybe, but for now she's my whore and I say you can't insult her."
Hunter," Funny you feel that way, but so be it... Now. Philippa. Talk."
Geralt, Last time I say this. Don't call her that.
Hunter, Why not? Would you be bothered if I cut off her pinky?
Geralt, Yes.
Geralt, What's it they say? Quality over quantity? 'Cause if it were about
Hunter, You must think you're funny.
Hunter," Maybe he is, fuck if we know. Thing is, we've no sense of humor."
Geralt, You're not gonna rip her tongue out.
Hunter, Cause¹ why?
Geralt, Cause¹ this.
Geralt, Hands off.
Hunter, What'd you say?
Hunter," Agh, sensed it. Knew we couldn't trust him... Witcher, witch... One"
Hunter, So they can burn at one and the same stake.
Geralt, Here's where we split up. Go meet Menge. Merigold'll be next door.
Hunter, You can't have her until I get--
Geralt, You don't set the terms here! Dirk! You know what to do.
Triss," You won't get a word out of me. Not you, not him."
Hunter," Playin' tough, eh? Just you wait... We'll take a fingernail or three."
Geralt, Do what you want.
Hunter," Come on, witch... Show you the wonders a pair of pliers can work."
Geralt, Fine. Take her. I'd rather she didn't interrupt my conversation. But
Hunter, Why? Feel sorry for the bitch?
Geralt, No. Couldn't give a shit about her... But if I don't get what I want
Hunter," Keen nose for enterprise. You'd make a great madame. Don't you worry,"
Geralt, No torture till I get there. Got it?
Hunter, Got it... No torture...
Hunter, Wha...? Whoreson's castin' spells! Get him!
Geralt," All right, had enough of this charade."
Hunter, What're you on about?
Geralt, Watch and learn.
Menge, I believe I told you not to let anyone in.
Hunter, Unless they had information concernin' Philippa Eilhart... This witcher
Menge, Anyone can claim that.
Torturer," We'll start with your pinky nail. Nah, let's go for your ring finger."
Triss, Aaaach!
Hunter, But it's not that easy to bring us Triss Merigold.
Menge, Is that who I hear...? Very well. I'll go see her shortly. But first --
Geralt, Not in the mood.
Menge," You've two choices, witcher... Drink, or die."
Geralt, There's a third option.
Menge, Oh yeah? What might that be?
Geralt, I'm going to kill you.
Menge, Guaaaaards! In here!
Geralt, Why the drink?
Menge," Triss Merigold has been captured... An occasion worthy of a toast,"
Geralt, Tell your boys to leave Triss alone first.
Menge, Not a chance. The bitch must howl.
Geralt, I've tried to be polite. You just won't let me.
Menge, Guaaaaards! In here!
Geralt, Cidarian.
Menge, A 1261 vintage. Year of the massacre of Cintra.
Torturer, Ah -- stop squirming. Heh. This little piggy went home!
Triss, Aaah! Stop!
Menge," Kurt, please see why Miss Merigold squeals so convincingly. Perhaps she"
Geralt, Speaking of metal...this goblet's silver. Making sure I'm not a
Menge," Ah, it's immediately apparent -- a professional. I find that refreshing."
Geralt, Still haven't paid me for the witch... Yet your hunters are already
Menge, What of it?
Geralt, You're damaging goods you haven't paid for yet.
Geralt, Enough. Let Triss go. Now.
Menge, What? Who are you to give me orders?
Geralt, A man with a sharp sword who doesn't like to repeat himself.
Menge, Guaaaards! In here!
Geralt, Got a silver sword on my back. That not enough?
Menge," It proves nothing. Dopplers can change their bodies at will, into"
Geralt, See you're an expert on dopplers.
Menge, I'd expect a witcher of all...things...to understand the value of
Geralt, No way around this?
Menge, Of course there is. Dopplers also assume their true form when
Geralt, See you're an expert on dopplers.
Menge, I'd expect a witcher of all...things...to understand the value of
Torturer, This little piggy had roast beef...
Triss, Aaayye...! You bastard... No...
Torturer, This little piggy had none...
Triss, Aaa... Aaaaa...
Menge," • Now, let us talk shop."
Geralt, Awfully generous. Why?
Menge, Well...you've turned in your lover. The emotional trauma it must
Geralt," Yeah, I've ploughed Triss. But what does it matter if you're paying"
Menge, Oh yeah...haha. Nearly forgot -- the mutations strip witchers of
Geralt, No idea what you're talking about...
Menge," You underestimate me. You see, I know everything about Merigold --"
Geralt, You seem well informed... So you have to know Triss betrayed me
Geralt, Think I just changed my mind. Let her go.
Menge, Didn't take much to get you to break. Guaaaaards! In here!
Triss, No... No more... I can't...
Torturer," Be brave, dear -- just one more fingernail and we'll move to the"
Menge, You surprise me... Geralt. Perhaps we can do deal after all. So. You
Geralt, It's simple... Free Dandelion.
Menge," A degenerate bard for information about Philippa... Tempting offer, I"
Geralt, When's this morally instructive spectacle due to take place?
Menge, When I issue the order. In person. Dandelion will remain in the
Geralt, All right. So free Dandelion.
Menge, First you ask me about a criminal's treasure... Now you want me to
Geralt, No doubt we're cut from the same cloth. But we don't have to agree
Menge," We need not agree any terms, either. I could simply force you to tell"
Geralt, Doubt that. I really doubt that.
Menge, Whereas I'm a man of great faith. Guaaaards! In here!
Geralt, I'm looking for a treasure. Was Sigi Reuven's until recently...
Menge," Well, well... Furthering the cause of the Eternal Fire on one hand,"
Geralt, I work for whoever pays me.
Menge, Like a whore?
Geralt, More or less. Just offer a different range of services. Where's the
Menge," Secure in a Koviri bank. Far and safe from you, far and safe from"
Geralt, Got information about Philippa. Thought you might want to buy it...
Menge, I do. But not at any price.
Geralt, Know what? Fuck you. Had enough of this masquerade.
Menge, Guaaaards! In here!
Menge, But first let's see how Miss Merigold fares. Its... It's grown
Triss, He say where Dandelion is?
Geralt, Yes... But...
Geralt, Triss...
Geralt, How do I say this... That was just a bit premature.
Triss, What do you mean?
Geralt, Menge said Dandelion's locked up on Temple Isle. Dungeon right under
Triss," Shit... I'm sorry, Geralt... I...should've thought this through,"
Geralt, What's done is done.
Geralt, After what they subjected you to... No need to explain.
Geralt, I should tend to your wounds...
Triss, No need. I'm fine. Well...mostly fine. Should heal in time for my
Geralt, Sorry. Shoulda gotten you out sooner...
Triss, Don't apologize. I knew what I was signing up for.
Triss, He... He'd never have agreed to help us... Even if I...
Geralt, I know. Let's not dwell on this. We should think about what to do
Triss, Dandelion's safe for now... Though out of reach. We don't stand a chance
Geralt, Let's search his corpse.
Triss, Right... Could find something that'll help us... Just his office key
Geralt, What is it?
Triss, The key to a vault. Here. Give it to Dijkstra with my regards. 
Geralt, Could you...revive him?
Triss, Maybe... If I actually practiced black magic. Haven't sunken that low
Geralt, Saw Menge burn a sheet of paper -- right before we came in here.
Triss," Could've been something on it that would've helped us. Argh, too late"
Geralt," So, there's no way you can recover the note...?"
Triss," Sadly, no. I'm a sorceress, not a miracle worker."
Triss, Nothing but dead ends... We'll need to make do...
Geralt, Menge's the only one who could've ordered Dandelion's release.
Triss, Yes... Or someone who looks exactly like him...
Geralt, A doppler?
Triss," Mhm. Your old friend, Dudu Biberveldt -- impersonated the halfling"
Geralt," Yeah. Except Dudu's in hiding now. Priscilla might know something,"
Triss, Fingers crossed.
Geralt, Breaking Dandelion out's starting to look like our last option...
Triss," Geralt, you know me... I'm all for finding solutions. I don't give up"
Geralt, Anyone actually tried?
Triss," They've tried, Geralt -- I've tried, to be exact. Shortly before you"
Triss," Listen, there is one other thing I wanted to talk about. But not here,"
Geralt, I either go out another way...or ready my sword.
Triss," Geralt, over here..."
Guard, What the... Over here!
Triss, Think that's all of them... That was close.
Geralt, True. I prefer straightforward solutions.
Triss," Yeah. Fight first, ask questions later."
Geralt," No, he didn't. Sensed right off it was all a front."
Geralt, He did... Until I asked about the treasure.
Triss," Geralt... We talked this over, you agreed... Ugh, fine. Never mind."
Triss, We should search the office. Maybe we can find some documents mentioning
Geralt, Find anything?
Triss, Just his office key in his pockets. Here...nothing under the belt...
Geralt, What is it?
Triss, The key to a vault. Here. Give it to Dijkstra with my regards.
Geralt," I found a letter to Menge, from someone important. A spy, I think."
Triss, A spy?
Geralt, Take a look.
Triss," Drop boxes, secret signals... Yeah... Strong stench of spy craft"
Geralt, Be he does. Letter explains how to signal for a meeting -- no mention
Triss, Maybe Dijkstra can help. He knows everything.
Geralt, Everything? Slight exaggeration there.
Triss, I'm not so sure.
Geralt, Key to a vault? No address? Why do I doubt this'll make Dijkstra
Triss," Well, might keep him from setting his thugs on us, breaking our legs"
Geralt," Meaning, glass is half full?"
Triss," Of something strong, I hope..."
Geralt, All right. Nothing left for us here. Let's go.
Triss, Be glad to. Just not by way of the main gate.
Triss, This is where we split up. But first...let's burn this shack down.
Geralt, Agreed. We've left too much evidence.
Triss, Yeah. But I also need to blow off some steam.
Triss, That should do it. I'm going. You should too.
Geralt," Mhm. Not about to use the teleport, though. See you, Triss."
Lackey, You there! Mr. Reuven wants a word.
Geralt, Impatient old bastard...
Lackey, Wha?
Geralt, Nothing. Be there soon.
Reuven," Who do I spy? Why, it's Geralt of Rivia!"
Geralt, Ugh... Will you stop following me already?
Reuven, I will. Soon as you tell me where my treasure is.
Geralt, Me and Menge...didn't see eye to eye.
Reuven, How badly?
Geralt, Badly.
Reuven," I suppose that explains the smoke... My treasure's not in there, is it?"
Geralt, No. Your gold's in a Koviri bank. Here's the key to the vault that
Reuven," Well, well... Would've earned yourself a medal if I was in the"
Geralt, Didn't see it anywhere... And twenty tons of gold is hard to miss.
Reuven, You mean to say you've come to me empty-handed?
Geralt," First of all, you came to me. Second, I do have something in my"
Reuven, A vault? That I need to find on my own? You've not made things much
Geralt, That's all you're gonna say? No wry remark? No scintillating joke?
Reuven," Hahaha... You want a knee-slapper? Fine, I'll tell you one. Ready?"
Geralt, Spare me... I want my reward.
Reuven, Geralt... Do all you witchers have such nerve?
Geralt, Whaddaya mean?
Reuven, You lied to me.
Geralt, What?
Reuven, You knew from the start who robbed me. But you didn't deign to share
Geralt," No, I didn't. But I did deign to help you find your treasure, so stop"
Reuven," I jest you not, Geralt. You abused my trust."
Geralt, I can live with that.
Reuven," This time, yes, you'll live."
Geralt, How'd you find out?
Reuven, I ask the questions here.
Geralt," Not true. That was a statement. Come on, Dijkstra. This tough-guy act"
Reuven," Hahahah! Ah, Geralt... I should have you strangled, but I like you,"
Geralt, I like you too...you count without a county.
Geralt, That makes one of us.
Reuven," I know, I know... Oh, the sleep I lose because of that..."
Geralt, Now that we've professed our mutual feelings for each other... How'd
Reuven, Sensed from the start you were up to something. You didn't haggle
Reuven, And now... Time to settle things.
Geralt, That a threat?
Reuven," Quite the contrary. You helped me, witcher, so in spite of everything"
Geralt, Don't bother. I know what happened to Dandelion.
Reuven, Then take my coin. I always pay my debts... Even to liars.
Reuven, I take it you've still no idea what happened to Dandelion?
Geralt," None. Found someone who might know, though. A spy, I guess -- signs"
Reuven," A ruined house in Farcorners. Give the signal, and he'll show up"
Geralt, Thanks for your help.
Reuven," No need to thank me. Just paying off a debt. I always do, you know."
Geralt," Probably shouldn't ask, but...Dijkstra, how the hell do you know"
Reuven, I draw it all from the flight patterns of birds.
Geralt," Your sarcasm -- it gets tiring, you know?"
Reuven, I've far worse qualities than that. Believe me.
Reuven, And a final humble plea. Don't try to fool me again...ever.
step, meeting the spy in Farcorners. This
Geralt, Must be the drop box. Gave the signal. Spy should show up in Farcorners
Geralt, Now just to hide...and wait...
Geralt," Triss? How'd you know to-- Ah, Dijkstra, huh?"
Triss, None other. I couldn't resist... Really want to see this through to the
Geralt, Perfect place for a tryst...with Triss...
Triss," Mhm... Ceiling's collapsed, mold on the walls, mouse droppings in the"
Geralt, Shh. He's coming. Hide.
Spy, Menge?
Geralt, Indisposed. Very indisposed.
Spy, I don't know who you are... But you're in deep. Shit right up to your
Triss," You're in deeper, I assure you... But answer our questions, and we'll"
Spy, My answer to each question will be the same: sod off.
Geralt, That's no way to talk to a lady.
Spy," To a lady, I'd never...but to a witch?"
Triss," You can. Wouldn't recommend it, though."
Geralt," You'll talk. Just a matter of time. So save us some, yourself some,"
Spy, Or what?
Geralt, Or I'll have to hurt you. Permanently.
Spy, I see you know your way around an interrogation... So do I. You're the
Triss, That's where you're wrong.
Spy, Aaaaaargh!
Triss, Had enough?
Spy, Ffffff... Fffffuck off... I can take this...
Triss, Of course you can. But I'm just getting started.
Spy, Aaargh!
Triss," You must be thinking: this can't possibly hurt any worse... Oh, it"
Spy, Aaarrgh! Enough...ugh! Enough!
Geralt," Triss, stop."
Triss," First, let him--"
Geralt, Please.
Geralt, So? Gonna talk?
Spy, Depends...on the question.
Spy," Yes, yes! Just tell me what the fuck about!"
Geralt, We're looking for Dandelion. We know Menge captured him.
Spy, Th-that? That's what this is all about? A fucking minstrel? You might've
Geralt, Pure curiosity... Who do you work for?
Spy, Won't say. No way.
Triss, Sure about that?
Spy," Yes. No matter what you do, witch... That I will never reveal."
Spy, Hgh ugh hghgh... Radovid. I work or Radovid.
Geralt, Radovid -- what'd he hope to gain by helping Menge?
Spy, He seeks to clear the field. Before he arrives.
Geralt, Makes sense. Easier to take a city whose mages are gone.
Triss, Bastard...he'll pay for this.
Spy, I can't believe it... For a miserable sap like that...
Geralt, Get to the point.
Geralt, You expect an apology?
Spy," No... But I've a right to be surprised, don't I?"
Spy, Dandelion is on Temple Isle. In the dungeon beneath the shrine. Menge's
Geralt, Afraid you'll have to call off the show.
Triss, How can we free Dandelion?
Spy, Those who leave Temple Isle do so only on Menge's orders... Issued in
Geralt, Dammit...
Triss, We'll find a way. I have an idea. Tell you later.
Geralt, Enough... We've learned everything we wanted to.
Spy, Glad to hear it. Can I assume we can put this unfortunate incident
Triss, Not so fast. Geralt...
Geralt, I know. He's seen too much.
Spy, But why... I told you... I'll never...
Triss, Either he dies... Or I wipe his mind.
Geralt, As good as lit the pyres with Menge in the square. He deserves to
Spy, But... But I helped you... I help--
Triss," Faeren, angau."
Geralt, Strip him of his memory.
Spy, But... But I helped you... I help--
Geralt, It's not so bad. I promise.
Triss," Caesle, angaef."
Geralt, How do you feel?
Triss, Base. Cruel. Vile. I could go on...but I need to get out of here --
Geralt, Really showed your claws today...
Triss, Is that how you see it? I'd put it differently. I showed how little I
Geralt, Said you had an idea -- about freeing Dandelion...
Triss, Yes... We know he's on the island. And he'll stay there until Menge
Geralt," Mhm. Problem is Menge's dead, so..."
Triss, No one else knows that. He could've escaped in the fire... He could
Geralt, A doppler?
Triss," Mhm. Your old friend, Dudu Biberveldt -- impersonated the halfling"
Geralt, Yeah. Except Dudu's in hiding right¹ now. Priscilla might know
Triss, Fingers crossed.
Geralt, Walk you home...?
Triss," Not today, Geralt. Not today. But... There is this one other thing I"
Triss," Listen, there's one other thing I wanted to talk about. But not here"
QUEST, IN CIRI'S FOOTSTEPS (NOVIGRAD) |_
Geralt," Think I know how to free Dandelion. Got a plan, but we need Dudu, gotta"
Priscilla, This...plan? What is it?
Geralt," Our doppler friend will assume Menge's form, order Dandelion moved to"
Priscilla," Brilliant, but how do you aim to find Dudu?"
Geralt, You're his friend -- any idea where he might be hiding?
Priscilla," With a doppler, the question is never ""where,"" but ""as whom."" In"
Geralt, We need to convince Dudu to reveal himself. Any friends we could
Priscilla," Dandelion, Irina Renard's¹ troupe -- that's all, really. I'm not"
Geralt, Known Dudu long?
Priscilla, I know this might sound strange but...I can't be sure. It seems
Geralt, Can't blame him for making the effort.
Priscilla, Thank you. I failed to notice him at first. Then he decided to
Geralt, What tipped you off? How'd you know it wasn't Dandelion? Dudu not
Priscilla," No, he simply spoke about something other than himself."
Geralt, So he liked going to the mummings...?
Priscilla, Yes. I'm actually surprised he didn't come to us after it all
Geralt, Hmm... So if these mummers are ready to help...
Priscilla, We need only mention Dudu. Irina and company are deeply indebted to
Geralt," Maybe we could use a play. You know, work a message to Dudu into"
Geralt, Dudu and the mummers -- how'd they meet?
Priscilla, That was my doing. Some opening night. Maxim lay comatose in his
Geralt," And Dudu revealed himself to them, just like that?"
Priscilla," I didn't think it wise to tell anyone, but Dudu and Irina took to"
Geralt, That he started performing with you?
Priscilla, Yes. Now Irina feels terribly guilty. They let him put himself in
Priscilla," Not a bad idea, but I doubt a few lines would suffice. Besides, do"
Geralt, So what do you suggest?
Priscilla," We must write an entire new play, from scratch. Something grand,"
Geralt, All right. Guess we can start writing the play.
Geralt, Not sure I'm cut out to write a play. Maybe you're better off doing
Priscilla," It's sure to go quicker if you help me. You'll see, we'll have a"
Geralt, We'll write the thing later.
Priscilla, Good. I'll have more time to prepare. You may wish to speak with
Geralt, Be back soon. See you.
Priscilla, Any ideas for the plot?
Geralt," Actually, I was hopin'--"
Priscilla, The key is to convince Dudu that he can rely on you. And that we
Geralt, More or less.
Priscilla, That'll do.
Geralt, Not entirely.
Priscilla," Tough, you'll need to pick it up as we go along. There's no time"
Geralt," Yeah, all clear."
Priscilla," Now to find the proper expressive form for our content. A gripping,"
know, Lorenzo Molla. A tale of a handsome but ruthless
Geralt, Sounds great.
Priscilla," Really think so? Lorenzo Molla, yeah... Hm... Or perhaps not."
Geralt, Let's keep thinking. That seems a bit...
Priscilla," Too fresh? Right you are. Wait, give me a minute... I've got it!"
Priscilla," We shall stage a story of the Urcheon of Erlenwald! Secret lovers,"
Geralt, But--
Priscilla," At which point he reveals his face! He's a monster, there to steal"
Geralt, We need a good title. Venture to say that's more important than the
Priscilla, I've some ideas -- perhaps you can choose.
Geralt, Gonna consider my opinion this time?
Priscilla, Of course. We're partners in this. I'm just in charge.
Geralt, Will I get a say in any of this? Or have you decided everything
Priscilla, Why are you cross? It's the nature of the creative process -- we
Geralt, Meaning yours.
Priscilla," Well, you must admit I'm better acquainted with the theater."
Priscilla," I've too really good ones: ""The Doppler's Salvation"" and ""A"
Geralt," Let's go with ""The Doppler's Salvation."" It's shorter, catchier."
Geralt," ""A Changeling Rescued, or the Witcher's Triumph"" -- really emphasizes"
Geralt, Just one problem -- no dopplers in that story. Just a princess and a
Priscilla, Nothing simpler. We need merely swap the doppler for the urcheon.
Geralt, All right. So it's a comedy?
Priscilla," I was thinking more along dramatic lines, but if you'd prefer"
Geralt," Hm, you're right. A drama'd be better."
Geralt, Think comedy's the safer option.
Priscilla," Very well. I must get to work. While you...must pick a corner, sit"
Geralt, Fine. Since you don't need help with the writing...
Priscilla," Geralt, wait. A rhyme for ""witcher""?"
Geralt," Err...""did itch her""?"
Priscilla, Ugh. Just keep quiet.
Priscilla," Ahh, done. I could make a small masterpiece of this had I a bit more"
Geralt, We're fresh out of that. The hidden message to Dudu -- what'd you weave
Priscilla, Hidden message?
Geralt," You were gonna work something in, like ""Come to the Kingfisher at dawn"""
Priscilla, That wouldn't be in keeping with the tone of the play! Not at all!
Geralt," You wrote it to contact Dudu! That was the purpose... Fine, so how do"
Priscilla, I don't know. I was counting on recognizing him by his scar...or
Geralt, Join us later. See ya.
Geralt, This where Madame Irina's troupe performs?
Seller," Yeah. But you can only enter with a ticket. There's no performance now,"
Geralt," No performance, said so yourself."
Seller, You can still get a ticket. What'll it be? Need a ticket?
Geralt," Yeah, one."
Seller," Here. Just stay outta sight, eh? Awful bashful, these mummers in"
Geralt, No. No need.
Seller, So be it. But you'll not get in. Whores through a window -- them you
Irina," Almost. That was almost it, but-but--"
Actor, Well? What was wrong that time?
Irina, I don't know anymore... It simply needs more fire!
Geralt, Madame Irina? Can we talk?
Irina, Geralt of Rivia! Dandelion's told us so much about you! Is he with you?
Geralt," No, but I hope to bring him back soon. Here to talk about Dudu."
Irina," Hm. Let's speak in my quarters, at the back of the theater. We'll be"
Irina, How can I help? We've not seen Dandelion or Dudu recently...
Geralt, I wanna stage a play. Something that'll really draw the crowds.
Irina," I see... And you hope it will get Dudu's attention as well, draw him"
Geralt," Priscilla, actually. She's done writing it. Tells the story of a"
Geralt, Dandelion's in trouble.
Irina, That much I guessed -- though I am curious how serious it is. Did he
Geralt, Worse. Lots. I'm gonna try to help him. Gotta contact Dudu first.
Irina, But he's disappeared as well.
Geralt," Have a plan to lure him out of hiding, but I need your help. Can I"
Irina," Naturally, but can we possibly do...?"
Irina," Hm, sounds interesting. I'll gladly have a glance, but first we must"
Geralt, Think we need ushers? A play about dopplers could be controversial...
Irina," Can't be sure if you've attended many performances, but Novigrad"
Geralt," Rotten apples, tomatoes, eggs -- that sort of thing?"
Irina," Axes, butchers' knives and bricks, usually."
Geralt, All right... Know anyone appropriate?
Irina," Try the docks, perhaps. You're bound to find some men willing to do"
Geralt, How can I help you spread the word about the premiere?
Irina," Well, we'd like all the city to hear about it, so we must clearly talk"
Geralt, Who're the Puffins?
Irina, Street artists. Get them to announce the premiere and even the mussels
Geralt, Where'll I find them?
Irina," They did occupy some room in the Bits, in a townhouse, but I can't be"
Geralt," See if I can find them, and if they'll work for us."
Geralt, Thanks for helping. I'll come back once I've found some ushers.
Irina, See you then.
Geralt, Good fight. Some nice footwork there.
Solus, Challenging me or is it Hal you wanna face? A witcher versus the Beast
Geralt, Like to hire you to help out. We're staging a play.
Solus, Need us to kick some arse on stage?
Geralt," Actually want you to usher, keep the peace, make sure no one's ass"
Geralt, You guys really from Nilfgaard?
Solus," We's from ploughin' Metinna, dammit. Not Nilfgaard. Raised by wolves"
Solus, Got the wrong men. Arse-kicking's what we do.
Geralt, I'll pay you well. Stand to make more than you do here.
Solus, Expecting trouble? Will we need to bust some heads?
Geralt, Can't rule it out. Bricks could start flying -- heard that from a
Solus," Hal! Wanna smash some bricklayers? Oh, he does, he does! Or I don't"
Geralt," How about a wager? If I beat Hal, you'll come work for me -- gratis."
Solus," Hmmm, see, Hal's no fan of mummings. Failed romance, spare you the"
idea," take us both on, same time. Fight of the century -- a witcher"
Geralt, What if I lose?
Solus," Oh, you'll lose. But we'll still do your little job. You'll just pay"
Geralt, Not in the mood for a fight. Can't I just pay you?
Solus," How it always is with you ploughin' Nordlings. Hal! Finish up, will"
Geralt, Fine. Fight you both.
Solus," Cough up the coin first. Lose, and it stays with us."
Geralt," Double your wages. As promised. But if I win, I get it back."
Solus, Hal! Finish 'im! Got somethin' special lined up!
Geralt, Gotta think about it.
Solus, Go and think. Much as you want.
Solus," Well, well... Ain't often you get such a lovely thrashin', eh, Hal?"
Solus," Fought well, white one. Hal liked you. Can see it in his smile. We've"
Geralt," Nice tune... Damn sad, though."
Woman, Then it successfully conveys my mood... What do you seek here?
Geralt, Looking for the Puffins... Have I found them?
Woman, We've no coin. Leave us be!
Geralt, Think there's been a mistake...
Woman, Sorry... Thought our landlord had hired another thug to collect from
Geralt," Don't want any coin from you. In fact, I'm willing to pay you,"
Man," Oof, afraid that's impossible... Ever since we premiered our fateful"
Geralt, Another thug? Flattered. Thanks.
Woman," Forgive us... You look threatening, and we've had our fair share of"
Man, Nissa's on edge these days. We all are.
Geralt, Never mind... So long.
Geralt, Fatso's gang?
Man, Common thugs in the Church's pay. City's full of gangs like that now.
Woman, They threatened Nissa -- said they'd round off her pointy ears with a
Nissa," They don't let us perform, chase away spectators, destroy our"
Geralt, All right... Say I get Fatso and his boys to leave you alone. Will
Nissa," Of course, but... You shan't find it easy. There's no talking to that"
Geralt, I'm not a great talker anyway.
Geralt, They harm any of you?
Man," No, not yet. But it's merely a question of time."
Woman, Nissa overheard talking about setting fire to something.
Geralt, So you're the ones...
Bandit," Oi, Fatso, look what we got here. Is it just me, or you got cat eyes?"
Bandit, Right he does! Stray cat must've fucked his mum! Heheheh!
Bandit," Now what you doin' in the city of the Eternal Fire, catshit?"
Geralt, Leave the Puffins alone.
Bandit, Worms that insulted Heirarch Hemmelfart? Called him a whoremonger?
Bandit, Tell them fuckin' poets to come down here. Shove their flutes up
Bandit," Yeah, they'll play a different tune then -- every time they fart!"
Geralt, Get out of here. Now.
Bandit, Wha?!
Bandit, Fuck yeah!
Geralt, Give you coin to leave.
Bandit, Fine. Give 'er here.
Bandit," Cept¹ we're not goin' nowhere. Well, Yohan might run and get some"
Geralt, I really dislike being cheated.
Bandit, Come on then. Gonna rip me?
Geralt, You guessed it.
Geralt, Trash like you -- not even worth bruising my fists.
Bandit, Look at that! Tough guy's turned coward! Harharharharhar!
Geralt, Leave the Puffins alone.
Bandit, Aye... We will... Alone...
Bandit, What the hell?
Bandit," Black magic! He's a fuckin' witch, get 'im!"
Geralt, Never mind. I'm going.
Bandit, Fuck off then! No one's keepin' you!
Man," Ah, what a sight! You really showed them! One, two... Over the back! Then,"
Nissa, I'll finally be able to leave my home without hiding beneath a hood.
Geralt, C'mon... It was nothing...
Woman," Oh, it was something all right! And don't dare think we've forgotten our"
Geralt, How much'll I owe you?
Nissa, Not a copper! Helped us out. See no reason why we shouldn't help you.
Man, Some quick preparations and we'll be out in the streets! Till the next!
Bandit, I dare you to say it again!
Man, I...I didn't say nothin'...
Bandit," Not enough he's a heretic, he's also a liar! What'll we do with 'im?"
Bandit, We'll bruise his kidneys... Unless he's got somethin' in that pouch...
Geralt, What the hell's this?
Bandit," What's it to you, you prancin' freak?"
Bandit," Look, he's scared off our new friend. Can't have a civil conversation"
Bandit, This is the city of the Eternal Fire. No room for his kind here.
Bandit," Ah, oh! All right -- enough! Dammit, enough! Boys, leg it!"
Man, Who... Who are you?
Geralt, Geralt. A witcher. Looking for the Puffins -- that you?
Woman," Yeah, that's us...but...you thrashed Fatso's boys. We saw everything"
Geralt, They your friends?
Man," No! The opposite! They'd been hounding us, we dared not leave our home"
Geralt, Got a job for you. Madame Irina's preparing a premiere. Need you to
Man," Why, we'd be delighted!"
Geralt, How much I need to pay you? We want the whole town talking about it.
Woman," Argh, nonsense. We shall do it for free. You rid us of those bullies"
Geralt, All right... You'll want to see Madame Irina to get the details.
Man, We'll see her right away. You know it's heartening -- a witcher not just
Geralt, Shit happens. See you at the premiere.
Geralt, What'd they want from you?
Man," We premiered a ballad recently -- ""Holy Hemmelfart, who his faith"
Nissa," They broke our instruments, dispersed our crowds... Lately, they took"
Geralt, Didn't look terribly pious to me. Church of the Eternal Fire hire
Man," Yes, the city's full of such gangs."
Geralt, Glad I could help. Farewell.
Irina," Ah, there you are!"
Geralt, Managed to hire some ushers.
Irina, Wonderful. That's one matter resolved.
Geralt, Wanted to talk about the text itself.
Irina," Hm, it's not at all badly written. In fact, I quite like it! I was"
Geralt, See you later.
Irina," I've very clear ideas on who to cast as the Servant, the Witcher and"
Geralt, Who's playing the Witcher?
Irina, An amateur -- it'll be my first time working with him. But I'm
Geralt, Newcomer to the troupe?
Irina," In a sense... Oh, stop pretending you don't know. I'm talking about"
Geralt," It's a good idea. Doubt I'll get a standing ovation, but Dudu'll"
Irina," But...you will make an effort, won't you? Learn your lines, at least?"
Geralt," I'll give it a shot, of course."
Geralt," I'm no actor. Might not have noticed, but I'm a little low on"
Irina," But that's perfect. After all, you're to play the Witcher, not the"
Geralt, You're right. Just never thought I'd have to do something like
Irina," You'll be fine, dear. You need only strut on stage, great sword in"
Geralt," So, about the Princess -- small part, but an important one. Any idea"
Irina, Priscilla would be the obvious choice -- she's young and beautiful.
Geralt," Let's have Priscilla do it. No offense, but most people..."
Irina, ...greater importance to appearance than to talent. I understand. I
Geralt, Role's yours. Talent and experience trump looks in my book.
Irina, I'm honored. I shall give it my all.
Geralt, So who do you see playing the Doppler-Prince?
Irina, I'm finding it hard to decide between two candidates. Abelard Rizza
Geralt, Who's your other option?
Irina," Maxim Boliere. Outstanding actor and audiences love him, but sadly I"
Geralt, Let's go with Abelard. I'll take a reliable artisan over an
Irina, Rightly so... The project is risky enough without our casting Maxim.
Geralt, Let's risk it and give the role to Maxim.
Irina," He's had a good spell of late, so maybe he won't let us down."
Geralt, These performances bring in much coin?
Irina," Well, it varies. On good days the square is barely capable of"
Geralt," Hm, thanks."
Geralt, See you later.
Irina," Remember to study your lines. We've no prompter, so you must know them"
Geralt, Right.
Geralt," All right, got the cast figured out."
Irina, It seems so. Prepared to plunge headlong into your career as a mummer?
Geralt," We can start now. Looked over the script, out of curiosity... We can"
Irina," Well, we've no time to lose. Come to the stage."
Geralt, Working on it. Still need to learn my lines. It's a lot to
Irina, One who knows an entire bestiary and can blend dozens of alchemical
Geralt, Zoltan? What are you doing here?
Zoltan," Prissy told me you lot're puttin' on a play, with you playin' the"
Geralt, I'm not the lead...
Zoltan," So I thought to meself, I'd sooner shave me beard than miss that! Tell"

Servant, Majesty! The monster slayer awaits!
Queen," Show him in, I must speak to the man."
Geralt, I kill monsters for pleasure... And...
Geralt," To slay beasts most foul -- 'twas for this I was made,"
Servant," He's swallowed the bait, this fool of a witcher!"
Queen," Ah... My child will pity her love, this beast."
Servant," Gathered are we, a host fair and noble,"
Geralt," Alas, no monster do I see or hear..."
Geralt," Perhaps 'midst the guests he hides, in fear?"
Geralt, Maybe he hid...in the cellar... Or a barrel of beer.
Prince, My dear! Long have we -hic- hid our love's tender fires.
Prince, My dear! Long have we hid our love's tender fires.
Princess," Oh, darling, I will, I will, I will!"
Servant, Wait! With wine must we toast this moment joyful.
Prince," Treason! 'Tis not wine, but a brew spiked with silver!"
Geralt," Hark! Hark! 'Tis no prince, but a doppler impostor!"
Geralt, If the maid loves him... It seems we've lost her...
Geralt, Seems men's hearts can love for changelings foster!
Queen," Behold, witcher, the beast of which I spoke!"
Princess," Stop! Stop! Beast or man, 'tis my love, my betrothed!"
Geralt, Sheathe your blades! Fear a doppler? 'Tis a thing most foolish.
Geralt, But a lack of morals... And a surfeit of cakes...
Geralt," But a heart that is base, such as in this knave aches!"
Queen," Witcher, 'tis true! This wretch's foul suspicions..."
Geralt," Tis¹ our tale's end, good folk, and it's moral is this..."
Geralt, No monster is he whose shape can shift.
Geralt, Show love for the dopplers... As well as for fish.
Queen, The witcher is just -- a true doppler's friend.
Princess, Guard! Call the guard! Remove the traitor at once!
Geralt, Hey! Hear the princess' command? Come up here!
NPC," Come on then, guv'nor! Up you go! On stage!"
NPC, Toss the traitor scum in the dungeon!
Geralt," Don't be afraid. In the end, everyone'll live happily ever after."
Geralt, Doppler and princess wed the same night.

Dudu, Geralt! You recognized me! How'd you do it?
Geralt," Greetings, Dudu. Heard about that souvenir Whoreson left on your face."
Dudu, So...you know...everything? Have you seen Ciri?
Geralt, No. Still looking for her.
Zoltan, Geralt! Masterful! You did great! Haven't laughed that hard in ages!
Geralt, Explain one thing to me: how'd you and Dandelion manage to displease
Dudu, It's not as if we planned it...
Zoltan, Heheheh.
Geralt, I know Ciri went back to Whoreson's to get you. How'd you manage to
Dudu," I ran after her, wanting to keep up, but...I'd 'ave been a hindrance."
Geralt," Why didn't you find Priscilla or the mummers, contact them?"
Dudu," I came to a few performances, different shape each time, but I dared"
Dudu, I tried to find them -- Ciri and Dandelion. It was as if they'd turned
Zoltan," Slow down, marmalade. Hmmm. Geralt, when'd you last see Cirilla, hm?"
Geralt," A while, yeah."
Zoltan," For me, likewise. Must be a full grown lass by now. Dudu, do us a wee"
Dudu, Geralt?
Geralt," No, no need. I'll recognize Ciri when I see her. Sure of it."
Zoltan," I, uh...just thought you might want to see..."
Geralt, Transform...change into her.
Dudu," I feel strange, both of you staring at me bug-eyed. Is that enough?"
Geralt," Yeah, plenty. Bad idea."
Zoltan," Not angry with me, are ye, Geralt?"
Geralt, No.
Zoltan, I feel relieved.
Dudu, And Dandelion? Were you able to find him?
Geralt," Witch hunters nabbed him. But there's good news, too."
Geralt, We think we can free Dandelion. Just need your help.
Dudu, What could I do?
Geralt, Take on Menge's appearance. Then go and give the order for Dandelion
Zoltan, We'll lay an ambush in the ravine en route. Spring Dandelion from
Geralt, Menge's dead.
Dudu," Ugh, a fiend. Good thing someone finally killed it. Though another just"

Dudu, Wait... Not so fast. How am I to be Menge? And I've no notion where
Geralt," Listen, you'll manage. Everybody believes Menge's missing. You can"
Zoltan, My lads and me'll lie in the ravine. Geralt'll then join us and we'll
Dudu, But how am I to contact you as Menge? Send word that the convoy's left?
Geralt," You'll need to figure that out. Come on, guile's your middle name."
Geralt, Dandelion's on Temple Isle. Imprisoned there. You'll need to find
Dudu, But what if they grow suspicious? Start asking questions?
Zoltan, I'll bet my best axe no one'll pester the commander of the Temple
Dudu, Of course. It's that simple. Thanks.
Geralt, No one knows Menge's dead. Don't need to worry about being exposed.
Dudu, No one...save you? Would this have anything to do with the fire at the
Geralt, We were in the area.
Zoltan, Heheh... I sorely regret not seein' that!
Zoltan," So? We all clear? Dudu, get your arse to Temple Isle. I'm off to"
Geralt, Yeah. See you in the ravine.
Geralt, We could use a bit of support. Lemme talk to Dijkstra. Catch him in
Zoltan," We'd manage, we would, with just my lads, but if you miss Sigi that"
Geralt, He's the one's got a soft spot for me. Said so himself recently.
Dudu, Whoa! Wait! Hold on! What happens after? I-I hope you don't expect me
Geralt," No, once it's over, we expect to see you at the Rosemary and Thyme,"
Zoltan, ...to get pissed like wild badgers. So? Settled? Let's get to work!
Irina, You were marvelous! Not a single mistake!
Irina," Not bad, not bad at all...for your first time out. Just a few minor"
Irina," Oh, Geralt, Geralt... I fear I'd be more successful hunting a beast"
Geralt, Could be. You'd still be wiser not to try.
Geralt, The performance in general -- what'd you think?
Irina," I doubt the audience understood it all, but that's to be expected."
Irina," Here you are -- your fee. I must admit, your style of mumming, well,"
Geralt, At Kaer Morhen. Minimum expression means maximum effect. Thanks for
QUEST, IN CIRI'S FOOTSTEPS (NOVIGRAD) |_
Geralt," Recently mentioned you, uh, have something of a soft spot for me."
Reuven," Oh-hoo! That's quite the start, Geralt. What is it you want?"
Geralt, Need to carry out an ambush. Could use a few of your men.
Reuven, An ambush? What's this about?
Geralt, Gimme men who'll survive the fight -- they can tell you afterwards.
Reuven," Heheh...I really do like you, Geralt. That's why I'll give you not one,"
Geralt, Three's enough.
Reuven, Then it's settled.
Geralt," I was hoping for a number ending in ""teen."""
Reuven," Teen? How many ""best men"" you think I have?"
Geralt," Hm -- more than three, maybe?"
Reuven," I'll give you your ""teen"" once you tell me what you're planning."
Geralt, No can do.
Reuven," So, where should this elite trio of my best meet you?"
Geralt, Dijkstra...
Reuven, Shush! Remember: I'm Sigi.
Geralt," Here of all places, I'd think we can talk freely. Or are you afraid"
Reuven, Of course they spy on me. I'd be disappointed if they didn't --
Geralt," So how many of your best can you give me, Sigi?"
Reuven," Ah, all right, you've convinced me. Four."
Geralt, Fine.
Geralt, Need to attack a Temple Guard convoy.
Reuven," Hm, wouldn't have any other favors to ask, would you? Search your"
Geralt," You can only give me three men, really?"
Reuven," Since you aim to stick your prick in the Eternal Fire itself, I"
Geralt, Mean you refuse to help?
Reuven," I mean at the appointed time and place, you will find six men"
Geralt, As a bright summer day. Thanks.
Geralt, Seems everything's ready.
Zoltan," Aye. Soon as we catch site of 'em, we'll block the road, 'gainst the"
Geralt," Too suspicious. Think about it -- Menge disappears, then shows up"
Geralt, This ambush is simpler -- 'cause Menge was already planning to move
Zoltan," Ehh, I suppose you're right."
Geralt, Priscilla? What're you doing here?
Priscilla, Some child brought a note from Dudu -- the convoy will leave at
Zoltan," Never fear, my dear, you'll get your warbler back, just hope he's got"
Geralt, Go back to town.
Priscilla, Please...I shan't be any trouble.
Zoltan," Aw, c'mon, Geralt, leave it go, let her stay. Look at her, all"
Geralt," This is no place for her. Something happens, I don't wanna have to"
Priscilla," Need I remind you you're here to rescue Dandelion, not me? Seems I"
Geralt, Fine. But remember...
Geralt," Fine, she can stay. On one condition..."
Priscilla," I know. As soon as the fighting starts, I'm to stand at a distance."
Zoltan, Not much happening just yet. And it might be some time 'fore it does...
Priscilla," Well, how about a game of gwent?"
Geralt," Sure, let's play."
Priscilla," Have I won again? My goodness. So, another hand? If you've no"
Priscilla, This was a stupid idea.
Geralt, You're the one who wanted to play.
Geralt, Don't really feel like it. You two play.
Zoltan," Hm, all right, you know the basics, that's clear. Now we can play"
Priscilla, Hahahah!
Dwarf, They're comin'! They're comin' now!
Geralt," Priscilla, stay here."
Hunter, Heeey-rup!
Dandelion, Heeeeeeelp!
Geralt, Dandelion! Dammit...
Zoltan, Geralt! Go after him! Leave these here to us!
Dwarf, Watch out! Three more shits out the hole!
Geralt," Anyone ride through here? Two men, one slung over the saddle like a"
NPC," Oh, aye, somethin' o' the kind dashed by. Turned left, there. But 'twere"
NPC, What did you expect me to do? Chop his legs off at the knees? Didn't

NPC, They'll never find them all.
NPC," Argh, who the fuck's this now? Hey, you! What the hell's afoot here?"
Geralt, What is it?
Dwarf," You tell me! One o' them hunters barged into our hut, turned us out"
Geralt," There another man with him? Tall, dark-haired?"
Dwarf, Aye. Jabberin' the whole time.
Geralt," Mhm, Dandelion. So, hunter's barricaded himself inside? There another"
Dwarf," Truth be told, there is..."
Geralt, Wanna get rid of this hunter or not?
Dwarf," Honest? We'd see you all gone, but he'll do for a start. Here. The"
Geralt, Thanks.
Geralt, Where's this other way in?
Dwarf," Aren't you curious? It's an ordinary tunnel, back way out in case o'"
Dwarf," We don't let strangers in there, show it to 'em, even! And there's--!"
Dwarf, Hrmph. Shut it!
Hunter," Sit there. There, I said. And shut it!"
Dandelion," All right, all right. But what then? How long do you think you can"
Hunter, Quiet!
Dandelion," Don't worry about me, I'll be quiet. But those halflings? You can't"
Hunter, And how can I be sure you won't try anything?
Dandelion," I'll go with you. Not like I have a really have a choice now, do I?"
Hunter, And there'll be no trickery along the way? I could wring your neck like
Dandelion," Yes, but I also realize you won't. My corpse is worth nothing to"
Hunter," Viscount? Come on, everybody calls you Dandelion..."
Dandelion," That, my friend, is what we call an assumed identity. Can't expect"
Hunter, Quiet! I thought I heard something...
Dandelion," What? No, no, no! You see, me and gags, we don't-- Mff mmmmff!"
Dandelion, Geralt! Must you ruin everything? I had him right where I wanted
Geralt, Come on. We'll talk outside.
Dandelion, Priscilla? What are you doing here?
Priscilla, Are you all right? You had me worried sick!
Zoltan," Dandelion, you rascal! Got this lass to thank for us racin' after"
Dandelion, Shame you arrived too late to see us hoodwink that hunter! I had a
Geralt," Dandelion, I need to ask you something. It's important, so focus."
Dandelion," Ciri? I thought, seeing how you're here... You haven't seen her?"
Geralt, When'd you last see her?
Geralt, I know you tried to help her. Gotta say I'm having trouble
Dandelion," No one else came to mind. Maybe, given more time, I'd have done"
Geralt, Something went wrong...
Dandelion," So you've heard everything? I hope you're not mad, you can't be..."
Geralt, Heard enough about your plan. Need to know what happened to Ciri now.
Dandelion," We were on Temple Isle, running from Whoreson's men..."
Story," Breakneck Speed.""]"
Dandelion," Ah, what an adventure! One minute we were pulling off the heist of"
Priscilla," Yes, a splendid story, but I think I've had my fill of this"
Dandelion, Gave me enough material for a volume of ballads! And this one'll
Geralt, Nobody's gonna read that drivel.
Dandelion," Sheesh, what crawled into your britches and bit you?"
Geralt, I'm just...worried.
Dandelion," About who? Ciri? Have a little faith, Geralt."
Geralt, That all you care about -- the ballads this'll inspire? Ego swell a
Dandelion, What is that about?
Geralt, It's about Ciri!
Dandelion, Why would I ever worry about her?
Geralt, Right... Best bit's when the guard draped you over the saddle like a
Dandelion, Time will tell. You're getting to be grumpy in your old age.
Geralt, I'm just...worried.
Dandelion," About who? Ciri? Have a little faith, Geralt."
Dandelion, You have any idea how she fights?! The girl can take care of
Geralt, Mean this?
Dandelion," You get it from Whoreson?! Whoa, Ciri'll be overjoyed. Whoreson on"
Geralt, Ciri ever tell you what it is? And Whoreson -- why'd she go to him
Dandelion, She went to Whoreson because I took her there.
Geralt, Coulda guessed that was your idea.
Dandelion, What? Her magic bauble was broken -- Whoreson had access to the
Geralt, Whoreson's dead.
Dandelion," Oo, guess you're no stranger to fury, either. Weeell, can't say I"
Geralt," Well, he wasn't exactly thrilled."
Dandelion," Hey, while you were at it, you didn't think to put in a good word"
Geralt, Ran outta time.
Dandelion, You don't care a lick about your friends.
Geralt, You've made your bed -- lie in it.
Dandelion, You don't care a lick about your friends.
Geralt," No, but I'll make sure to mention it next time."
Dandelion," Thanks! Adventures are great, but they can be¹ hard to write up"
Dandelion, What about Sigi Reuven...how's he doing?
Geralt," Fine, last I heard."
Dandelion, That's too bad. 'Cause I have a sneaking suspicion he might be a
Dandelion," Besides, she needed help deciphering a curse...its incantation."
Geralt," Know any more about the curse? Something specific, a detail?"
Geralt, What was Ciri's interest in this curse? Did she want to cast it or
Dandelion, She wasn't all that willing to talk about it. I didn't want to
Geralt, The one time when it might've been useful.
Dandelion, But I'm almost positive she meant to lift it.
Geralt," Off who, what? Or was it about her directly?"
Dandelion," No... I don't think so... I mean, she didn't look cursed. But boy"
Dandelion," Hmm... Well, I know the words."
Geralt, You're kidding.
Dandelion," No. They were elven. Ciri was constantly repeating them to herself,"
this," ""Va fail, elaine, ceàdmil"
Geralt, Doesn't mean a thing to me.
Dandelion, Even less to me.
Geralt," Hm, the curse invokes ugliness... My entire life, I don't think I've"
Dandelion, Stunning Gemma?
Geralt," No, a certain deformed midget who appeared out of the blue on the"
Dandelion," Argh, you and Ciri -- like two water droplets. Never know what"
Geralt," She slipped away, again... I was so close."
Dandelion," Hmm... She came here from Velen. Somebody there helped her,"
Geralt, Doubt it. Talked to the baron there -- he's the one helped Ciri.
Dandelion, So? Skellige?
Geralt, Skellige.
Geralt," Maybe... Besides, the curse might've had something to do with Uma."
Dandelion," Uma -- the, uh, deformed midget? What will you do with him?"
Geralt," First, lift the curse. Maybe I can get some help at Kaer Morhen."
Geralt," Dammit, that's just not enough. Ciri say anything else?"
Geralt, Ciri ever mention him?
Dandelion, Some deformed midget? No.
Dandelion," Didn't say much at all, to be honest. Geralt, she's no longer that"
Geralt, Right...
Priscilla, You two have chattered enough. Now it's my turn to talk to
Zoltan, And I'll gladly have a go at him when you're done. Let's get back to
Dandelion," Weeell, I've certainly had my share of excitement for one day. A"
Geralt, I'm sure to be by sometime soon.
Dandelion," I'll hold you to that, Geralt. See you soon. And thanks again for"
NPC, But why ever would he want that?
NPC, Man'll be thrilled. Come on! Go!
NPC," Oy, Master Witcher! We've a gift for you! Uhh, hmhm... We're, uh,"
Geralt, Portrait of the heirarch. Nice.
NPC," Oh, it's nothing, really -- got oodles of 'em. Just...if you wouldn't"

Geralt, You captain of this tub?
Liglad, What's it to you?
Geralt, I'm Skellige bound. Need to get there.
Liglad," Start swimmin'. Islanders, the Black Ones -- all attack us in those"
Geralt," Come on. Clans are ready to deal, leave you alone if you do."
Liglad, Not likely. 'Cept maybe that daft bastard Wolverstone from the
Geralt, Hm. Where can I find him?
Liglad," In a pigsty, most times. Others -- the Golden Sturgeon. Ask for Flask"
Geralt, How much would it cost me to hire this ship?
Liglad," The ""Harmony of Nations"" ain't for hire. Ship's owners got plans for"
Geralt, There anyone in Novigrad who'll take me to Skellige?
Liglad," Tsk, you mean anyone here off their gourd? Aye, Wolverstone. Goes by"
Sentry," Where you scurryin' to, you wretch? Lemme see your pass."
Geralt, Pass? What pass?
Sentry, Kind of pass that confirms you ain't no mage. Can't enter or leave
Geralt, Sorry. Don't have a pass.
Sentry," You'll scurry no further, then. Next!"
Geralt, Hang on... How do I get one?
Sentry, Start by makin' an offerin' to the Church. Then you'll need three
Sentry, Wha? But where'd...
Geralt, Why've you shut the city gates?
Sentry," So's we can clean it of mages, witches and other scum that's crawled"
Geralt, Who's captain of this ship?
Woman," Lookin' at 'er. Aye, her. That's right: I, a woman, am captain --"
Geralt, Need to get to Skellige.
Woman," Not on this boat, you won't."
Geralt, Pay you well.
Woman, The islanders live off plunderin' the seas. Not willin' to risk that.
Geralt, Ever sailed there?
Woman, Listen -- the islanders attack all ships. When they hate someone --
Geralt, Farewell.
Geralt," You Wolverstone, captain of the Atropos?"
Flask," So you want to know...if I'm Atropos, cap'n of the Wolverstone...? No"
Geralt, I need to get to Skellige.
Flask," My Atropos and me, we're due to sail for Ard Skellig. Carryin' grain."
Geralt, Here. That enough?
Flask," Hefty sack, like a bull's. When do we sail?"
Geralt, Not sure you're ready. You can barely stand.
Flask," Know this, stranger. Captain Wolverstone never sails sober. The sea"
Geralt, Let's go.
Flask," Ah-ah-ah. First we must drink to the wind, to good fortune, and to"
Geralt, Gimme some time to prepare.
Flask, Prepare all you want. She's not done loadin' as it is.
Geralt, Gotta get more coin.
Flask, You sure do. For I won't even wet me arse in a bath without payment
Geralt," Back off, or I'll kill you."
NPC, I'm not afeard of dyin'.
Geralt, Rob every corpse that washes up on shore?
NPC," Takin' from corpses ain't theft. I'm a man o' the Isles. I don't reap,"
Geralt, See I've landed on Ard Skellig...
NPC, How you figure that?
Geralt, You're wearing Clan an Craite colors. Ard Skellig's their island.
NPC," On the Atropos, were you?"
Geralt, Yeah. Thought the captain had a deal with you.
NPC," With us? Meanin' who, exactly? Might've arranged somethin' with Lugos, but"
Geralt, Agreed to meet a sorceress here -- Yennefer of Vengerberg. She's
NPC, There's a witch at Kaer Trolde -- Crach's guest. Could be the one you're
Geralt, Seen her? Know what the sorceress looks like?
NPC, Aye. Wears black and white. If not for her tits you'd think she was a
Geralt, Yennefer's not all bad. Once you get to know her.
NPC," Heheh, take your word for it."
Geralt, What's your name?
NPC, Steingrim.
Geralt," Well, Steingrim, I don't like you. In fact, I feel like slapping"
NPC," Go ahead, drifter. You try."
Geralt, That scorn I hear in your voice?
NPC, You've good ears. Folk say this witch's got Crach wrapped around her
Geralt, Had enough?
NPC," Best finish me now, 'cause you'll be fucked once I catch my breath."
Geralt, It was a good fight. That's enough for now.
NPC, Know the way to Kaer Trolde?
Geralt, Expect I'll find it.
NPC," Head north, then turn west towards the bay before you come to the bridge."
Geralt, Thanks. So long.
Ermion, Our time amongst the living is but the wink of an eye. What's left when
Ermion," You need not do this, child."
Cerys, I know. But I want to.
Woman," Tis¹ madness, such a young lass..."
Man," Birna shold be the one goin', they shared a bed longer."
Ermion, Silence. 'Tis her decision.
Geralt, You look beautiful.
Yennefer, Thank you. Nice to see you again. The eulogy.
Ermion, King Bran of Clan Tuirseach has embarked on his final voyage. At its
Geralt, You knew Bran?
Yennefer, Yes. He was well respected. Unlike his wife.
Geralt, You smell wonderful.
Yennefer, Geralt -- we're at a funeral.
Geralt, You smell wonderful at this funeral.
Crach," Skellige is its clans. In times of war, tradition holds the clans unite"
Geralt, Come to the wake with me?
Yennefer," Gladly. Feasts in Skellige -- so predictable. Slobbering drunks,"
Geralt," Yeah, nothing like the banquets mages attend. Remember the one on"
Yennefer, You were there -- how could I forget? I also remember
Geralt, Hope we don't have to go to his wake.
Yennefer, Well... We don't have to go... Feasts in Skellige -- so
Geralt," Yeah, nothing like the banquets mages attend. Remember the one on"
Yennefer, You were there -- how could I forget? I also remember
Geralt, Haven't seen each other in two years. I want a solitary cottage by
Yennefer, What would we do there for a week?
Geralt, Got so many ideas...
Yennefer," The one with the rope you use for trophies, that one seems"
Geralt, Reading my mind again?
Yennefer," Mhm. What's more, I like what I see."
Geralt, Stop reading my mind.
Yennefer, Something to hide?
Geralt, Don't like secrets?
Yennefer, No.
Yennefer, Did you learn anything in Velen?
Geralt, How about you? What've you learned?
Yennefer, Something strange happened on Ard Skellig a time ago. A disaster
Geralt," As much as I respect your intuition, Yen, we need something specific,"
Yennefer, I'd know for certain if I was able to inspect the disaster zone.
Geralt, So why won't Ermion let you inspect the area of the anomaly?
Yennefer," Call it a difference of opinion. A large, loud difference."
Geralt, Ermion's head of the Skellige circle? Haven't seen him since...
Yennefer, Since Ciri was a little girl. I doubt he'll do you any favors.
Geralt, I'm not done searching Velen yet.
Yennefer, Thought you'd tend to that immediately.
Geralt, Change of plans.
Geralt, Didn't learn much in Velen. Ciri wound up at the home of a local
Yennefer, Good. You'll need to tell me more when we have some time.
Geralt, Velen -- awful place. Somehow Ciri wound up at the castle of the
Yennefer, Injured? Was it serious?
Geralt," Don't think so. Must've recovered, because this baron sent her to"
Yennefer, Witches?
Geralt," Creatures, more like. Can't say exactly what they are. But they're"
Yennefer, What on earth is Keira Metz doing in that wasteland?
Geralt," Hiding from witch hunters. Listen, she told me an elven mage had"
Yennefer, Good. You'll need to tell me more when we have some time.
Geralt, Ciri found Dandelion in Novigrad. They met up.
Yennefer, So Dandelion knows what happened to Ciri?
Geralt, Yeah. Gotta find him.
Geralt," Been to Novigrad. Ciri was there, looking for a way to lift some"
Yennefer, You're certain?
Geralt, Heard it from Dandelion -- with no embellishments.
Yennefer, Do you know any more about this curse?
Geralt," Not much. Ciri ran into some trouble, never finished what she went"
Yennefer, I'll look at it later.
Yennefer," Look, it's Crach."
Crach, White Wolf!
Geralt," Greetings, Crach."
Crach, I shall see you at the wake. And I'll not accept any excuses -- I've an
Yennefer, Guess our solitary hut will have to wait. Crach an Craite's someone
Yennefer, I shall wear black and white for the feast. I count on you to don

Yennefer," And just like Crach, I'll not accept any excuses. We're not here to"
QUEST, IN CIRI'S FOOTSTEPS (SKELLIGE) |_
Geralt, This's gotta be Yen's room. She always did like space. And luxury...
Geralt," Riiight... Just not something I'd ever wear. Buuut, what don't we do"
Brina, Lady Yennefer. So pleased you've come to pay your respects to my dead
Yennefer, I knew Konung Bran well. His passing is the Isles' great loss.
Brina, It is... We must do all we can to minimize its tragic consequences.
Yennefer, Bran was a great ruler.
Brina, He needs a worthy successor.
Yennefer, You speak as though you have someone in mind.
Brina, Skellige's troubles very much derive from it not being a hereditary
Yennefer, The King of the Isles is a more symbolic position.
Brina, And that should change as well. A strong leader who wields true power --
Geralt, Introduce me?
Yennefer," This is my friend Geralt, and this is Birna -- widow of the dear"
Birna," The Queen Mother. It's a pleasure to meet you, Geralt. You must"
Geralt, I'm Geralt. A witcher.
Birna," Birna. Queen of Skellige. I'm glad we've met, but you must forgive me."
Yennefer," I can see you chose your own outfit. You know, of course, that"
Geralt, Everyone's got their style.
Yennefer, Lovely outfit. You look...dashing.
Geralt, Thank you. You're...dazzling.
Yennefer," You know I really missed your candidness. I'm glad we're here,"
Geralt, We should mingle before they all get drunk. There'll be no talking
Yennefer," Good thinking. I don't know what Crach wants, but when we meet with"
Geralt, I'm not gonna drink. Why dull my senses when I'm in such pleasant
Yennefer, Do you plan to compliment me all evening?
Geralt, I plan to tell you what I think.
Geralt," Ugh, don't like funerals, don't like feasts."
Yennefer, I know. You also like underdone meat and being teleported. But
Yennefer," Geralt, there's something I've been meaning to ask you."
Geralt, Hm?
Yennefer, Your beard. Why'd you decide to grow it out?
Geralt, Don't really know.
Yennefer, Hm. Must say it suits you.
Arnvald, Lady Yennefer. Sir.
Yennefer," Greetings, Arnvald. My companion is Geralt of Rivia."
Arnvald, I am honored.
Geralt," Nice to meet you, too. Quite a few guests."
Arnvald, They come to bid their king farewell. They come to see the claimants
Geralt, We wanted to talk to Crach an Craite.
Arnvald, The jarl will join us shortly. He's assigned you a place of honor at
Yennefer, They've seated us here?
Cerys," I asked them to. Wanted to meet the notorious witcher, Geralt."
Geralt, We've met. Don't remember?
Cerys, That was ages ago. Hjalmar and I were children when you last visited our
Geralt," Forgive me, I remember our meeting those years ago, but I don't"
Blueboy," Cerys an Craite. Crach, her da, and her big brother Hjalmar call her"
Geralt," Seems they sat us with the sons of the jarls, exclusively."
Yennefer," Cerys an Craite is the daughter of the jarl, Geralt. Jarls'"
Cerys, Do you know every last one of 'em dreams of bein' Bran's successor?
Halbjorn," Cerys is jealous, for the one among us who perform the greatest feat"
Cerys, We all know the feats are a sideshow. Our fathers will choose who will
Halbjorn, You talk like that 'cause you're short on strength and skill.
Cerys," Had my reasons for not participatin'. But I woulda won then, as I'd win"
Geralt," Hm, now that you mention him...just noticed Hjalmar's not here."
Cerys, My brother walks his own paths. But about the race...why don't we repeat
Blueboy, If the witcher's in.
Yennefer, Geralt?
Geralt, Gladly. What're the rules?
Cerys," Whoever pulls Hjalmar's axe from the stump at the top of the hill,"
Blueboy, And here I was ready to puke from all the boredom! Let's go!
Geralt," Honored to be asked, but maybe some other time."
Halbjorn, Shame.
Blueboy, We're here. From this spot you must reach the top of that mount. At
Cerys, I'm ready.
Blueboy, You'll start when I sound the horn.
Geralt," I won, but only by a hair."
Cerys," No such thing. There's winnin', and there's losin'. And I lost. We'd"
Geralt, Let's.
Cerys, I'm first! Behold -- Hjalmar's axe. I beat the famous White Wolf.
Geralt, Congratulations.
Cerys, Let's go back.
Geralt, Be glad to tell everyone about your victory.
Geralt, See the wake's in full swing.
Blueboy, Lost sight o' youse. Who won?
Geralt," Cerys, proving she's her brother Hjalmar's equal in every way. She"
Halbjorn, Cannot be!
Blueboy, Now I know why Hjalmar named you Sparrowhawk!
Cerys, I lost.
Otrygg," Lost to a witcher, Sparrowhawk. That'd likely happen to any of us."
Otrygg, Enough of the natterin'. Let's drink!
Geralt, To Cerys!
Blueboy, Pass the mead and a tankard for the man!
Otrygg, To Bran! May he want for nothing in the world beyond!
Geralt, To my beautiful companion!
Geralt," Can't today, for good reason, believe me."
Halbjorn," If not today, then when?!"
Yennefer," You've been great company. Sadly, it's time we moved on."
Geralt, Really...?
Yennefer, Indeed. We must talk. But not here. You shall learn all beyond that
Donar," Tell me, Lugos, why're you sendin' your vermin to my isle?"
Madman, That squealin' swine sounds uncannily like Donar. Too bad I don't talk
Donar," Not talkin' to you, shitbrains. I'm warnin' you."
Yennefer," Allow me to introduce Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. Jarl Donar an"
Donar, Callin' Lugos a madman's an insult to madmen. He's a common goatfucker.
Madman," Call me a goatfucker one more time, and I'll chop off your head, stick"
Donar, Enough. Time to settle this -- here and now.
Madman," Oh, hahahah! Givin' me a true fright right now! Shat me best trousers!"
Geralt, Thought Skelligers called a truce for feasts.
Donar, I know the hallowed customs. But Lugos oughta know that I'll not let
Madman," You don't scare anyone, Donar. I'll be by soon to plough your"
Geralt, Settle this outside.
Madman," Who the fuck are you to advise me, eh?"
Yennefer, Someone with better manners. You insult Bran's memory and Crach's
Yennefer, Emperor would be very pleased to hear you quarrel.
Madman, His Imperial Majesty is more than welcome to visit.
Donar, Let 'im sail over here. We ain't afeard o' the Black Ones.
Yennefer, Raiding coastal villages is one thing. Total war with the empire is
Madman," Awfully mouthy, this one. Go stir your cauldron and pierce some boils,"
Geralt," Know what, Lugos? Just realized I don't give a damn about your"
Madman, Finally! Some diversion! And here I was ready to puke from all the
Donar, Move the benches! There's to be some gob slappin'!
Geralt," Calm down, Lugos."
Madman, No wench'll teach me how to fight.
Yennefer, That was not my intention.
Yennefer," Come, Geralt. I believe this discussion's run its course."
Madman," What do ya say to that, eh? Fat lot o' help they did you, them..."
Yennefer, What wenches don't like are boors. High time you learned that.
Madman, Your loss.
Geralt, Had enough?
Madman," Argh, aah, ye got me good. That were quite a wallop. Still seein'"
Geralt," We'll call it even, then, soon as you apologize to the lady."
Madman," Don't hold it against me, m'lady. It's my deep conviction"
Yennefer, No offense taken. Forget about it.
Madman," That I like. And the knockin' -- it's what men do. Gimme your paw,"
Madman," Witcher, have a drink with me. Proof there's no hard feelings. And"
Geralt," Sure, I'll knock one back with you, Lugos. Nothing wrong with having"
Yennefer," Geralt, I'd have nothing against drinking yourself stupid if"
Geralt, Nothing wrong with having a drink in good company.
Yennefer, I remind you we've important matters to discuss later. Matters
Geralt, I remember.
Madman," Drink like you fight, and we're in for a good time. To Bran!"
Geralt," To Jarl Madman Lugos and his madness! Forgive us. We should mingle,"
Geralt," No hard feelings, but we'll have to drink another time."
Yennefer, Yes. We've important discussions ahead.
Madman, You land rats're all the same -- afeard o' your wenches.
Geralt, What now?
Yennefer, Now we pay a visit to Ermion's laboratory.
Geralt, Didn't know we'd been invited.
Yennefer, Because we've not been.
Geralt, Take it Ermion won't be there?
Yennefer, That's right.
Geralt, And what's the purpose of this visit?
Yennefer, We're looking for an object -- the Mask of Uroboros. We'll need it.
Geralt, We shouldn't be breaking into Ermion's workshop.
Yennefer, If I didn't know you better I'd say you needed to grow a pair. But
Geralt, Why would we go there?
Yennefer," To retrive an item -- the Mask of Uroboros. We need it and,"
Geralt," Right, 'course."
Yennefer," Come, Geralt."
Geralt, Now you'll tell me why you need this mask.
Yennefer," Oh, I shall. In due course."
Geralt, Take it¹ you'll decide when.
Yennefer, Correct.
Yennefer, Footsteps. Shh... Guards. Hide behind the tapestry.
Guard," Sparrows chip, while starlings chirp."
Guard, What do jackdaws do?
Guard," Jackdaws caw. Goldfinches warble and cranes whoop, whereas peacocks"
Guard, Hmm... What about nightingales?
Guard," Ahh, right. Nightingales croon."
Geralt, That was close.
Yennefer, Mhm.
Geralt, This'll be tough to open.
Yennefer, Surprises never end. See the ravens?
Geralt, Hard not to.
Yennefer, Ermion's spies. An indication that we're near his laboratory. I also
Geralt, Seen uglier sights in my life.
Yennefer," Geralt of Rivia, being romantic."
Yennefer," Amazing how a hobby can render a man mysterious, fascinating."
Geralt, Especially a druid. Must be a real nature lover.
Yennefer, Please.
Yennefer," For teleprojection. A reflection of Ermion appears on the surface,"
Geralt, Aaa...
Yennefer, Are you all right?
Geralt, Cut myself. The door's locked.
Geralt," The animals -- they're alive! Yen, watch out! Monsters... Can feel"
Yennefer, That's one less!
Geralt, Strange. Smells of...mushrooms in here.
Yennefer, No... To my mind it's the smell of sweet grass drying in the sun.
Geralt, What's happening?
Yennefer," You were hallucinating. You ran at Ermion's animals, sword flailing."
Geralt," Uh, must've looked strange."
Yennefer, Your years of vigorous training at Kaer Morhen finally paid off.
Geralt, Please...
Yennefer, Fine. We've passed the Trial of Taxidermy. The door stands open.
Geralt," Mind if we, uh, never mention this again?"
Yennefer, Naturally. Door's open. We'll proceed as soon as you've collected
Yennefer," Let's go inside, Geralt. I'll lock the entrance. We don't want to"
Yennefer," ""Wondrous World of Insectoids,"" ""Ritual Plants""... Ah, what do you"
Yennefer, Ermion's wand. He's one of the few druids to use one.
Yennefer, Out of date.
Yennefer, Hrmph. That shameless schemer.
Yennefer, Little Ciri's handiwork. That's what she called him when he was her
Yennefer," It's not in the stone, don't you see? It's held there by a vise."
Yennefer, The islanders believe the wraiths sail on a longship built of the
Geralt, Looks like Ermion places something in the statue's hand.
Geralt, Whaddaya say we give it a pine cone...? Nothing.
Geralt," So, statue, how about a skull...? Hm... Guess you're no indecisive"
Geralt," How about a mug of mead? Statue or not, everybody needs a drink"
Geralt, Need something else. Gotta look around.
Yennefer, Ermion enjoys jests achieved at the expense of others. I've a
Yennefer," Geralt, come here! I've found the mask! This is it!"
Yennefer," We've got it. We must return to the feast quickly, before..."
Geralt," Careful, now!"
Yennefer, It's a trap! We're imprisoned!
Yennefer, Geralt. Hear that?
Geralt, Smelled it. Gas. Grate's still closed. Gotta think of something quick.
Yennefer," The damned druid will poison us! This vapor's deadly, we've but a few"
Geralt, Teleport us outta here.
Yennefer, Think of something! Quickly! First thing to come to your mind!
Yennefer, Hold on tight!
Yennefer," Hm. Damn. I tore a hole in my dress. Wait a minute, I must mend it."
Geralt, Know how to sew?
Yennefer, Please. I'll enchant a needle.
Yennefer, Wait.
Geralt, For what?
Yennefer, We must talk to Crach.
Geralt, Why? Think he misses us? Because I missed you.
Geralt, Oh no.
Yennefer, I missed you too.
Geralt, When are you gonna finally burn this piece of junk?
Yennefer," My heart couldn't take it. So many memories. Dammit, Geralt. Do"
Geralt, Come here. We gotta hurry. Crach's waiting.
Yennefer, Is that so?
Geralt," Yen, let go of the mane."
Yennefer, I know you. I let go -- you throw us off.
Geralt, Mhm.
Yennefer, Don't even try it.
Yennefer, My oh my.
Geralt, Missed you.
Yennefer, I missed you too.
Geralt, We oughta get back to the wake.
Yennefer, I must dress. Turn around.
Geralt, Really wonder if Crach'll be willing to help...
Yennefer, He knew Ciri well. She and Hjalmar played together as children.
Yennefer, There. Good as new.
Geralt, Let's get back to the wake.
Arnvald, Crach an Craite asked about you.
Yennefer, We went out...for a breath of fresh air.
Arnvald," Ahem, the claimants to the throne will step forth in a moment."
Woman, ...now heed my words. There is no greater act of valor than to fight a
Crach, Words of uncommon beauty. We thank you all and will take them to
Crach, My son could not be here this day. Behold his axe. Behold his will.
Crach, May the best man...or woman...win.
Crach, What's got into her?
Yennefer," She's your daughter, is she not?"
Crach," Now I know why she said she'll sail to Spikeroog. Ah, children! The"
Crach," How was it, Geralt, when Ciri was nearing womanhood? I remember well her"
Geralt, Ciri was impossible to control. No telling her what to do. Had to have
Crach, No specific reason. She and Cerys -- they're of a similar age. But we'll
Geralt, That's right.
Crach," If your require aid -- gold, ships, anything -- merely say the word. "
Geralt, Need your help. Ciri probably came here to Skellige...
Yennefer, And very likely caused the cataclysm along the coast. The site
Geralt, A site Ermion refuses to let us explore.
Yennefer," Specifically, he won't let me explore it. We fought, we're not"
Geralt," Magic anomaly on Ard Skellig's somehow related to Ciri, or so"
Yennefer, It's my strong suspicion. But I can only know for certain by

Crach, I've one more matter to broach -- my children. You remember Hjalmar?
Geralt, Giants...they've been extinct for ages. Anyone actually seen the one

Crach, There's no curse to speak of. Cerys has decided she must match Hjalmar
Geralt, Think she might need my help? You did plan to ask me for it. Why?
Crach," The thing is, I don't trust Udalryk further than I can spit. Cerys"
Geralt, Can't help wondering -- got no plans to vie for the crown yourself?
Crach," A good number? Those opposed would be fierce, rabid. Madman Lugos"
Geralt," If either Hjalmar or Cerys need help, I'll help them."
Geralt, I'll talk to Cerys. Count on it.
Crach, I thank you.

Ermion," You're mad, woman! Mad, I say!"
Yennefer, Maybe. But I've got good reason.
Ermion, I hold Ciri dear too. You know this! Damned well! But the Mask of
Yennefer," No, but neither do you. So stop panicking."
Geralt, Can hear you two clear on the other side of the island.
Ermion, Good! May all Skellige know Yennefer of Vengerberg is a common thief!
Yennefer," Control yourself, druid. I haven't stolen anything. I've merely"
Ermion," Hah! The generosity! Just one small problem -- once used, the mask is"
Geralt, Bury? What're you talking about?
Ermion, She's not told you? Might've expected as much!
Geralt, Don't exaggerate. It's just--
Ermion," No, Geralt. This is¹ no ""just""!"
Ermion, The myth is Uroboros created the Mask when the envious Sea swallowed
Geralt, So... No one's ever used the Mask?
Ermion, No... But...
Geralt," So you don't actually know if it works, how it works?"
Ermion, Of course I do. The myths tell me.
Geralt, Where'd you get this mask?
Ermion, Sailors from clan Dimun pulled it from the sea. Near the Njord
Geralt," Yeah, but how can you be sure this is Uroboros' mask?"
Ermion, Its appearance is exactly as described in the myths.
Geralt, You believe the myths?
Ermion," Only ignorant fools belittle their significance. Besides, it's not the"
Geralt, I'm not about to justify when Yennefer did...
Ermion, Then don't!
Geralt," ...but try to understand her. She's not doing this to anger you,"
Ermion," I know there are maternal feelings at play, but this is no excuse,"
Geralt," On the one hand a theft. On the other, Ciri's life..."
Ermion, I also care deeply for the girl. I proposed a series of other
Geralt, True. Least this time she's got a valid reason for it.
Ermion, Never mind that she might bring--
Geralt," Theft or no theft, Crach gave us free rein."
Ermion," First off, this might indeed be his isle, but we the druids watch"
Ermion, Wha...what was that? No! Yennefer's used the Mask! Quickly! Follow me!
Ermion, Eine glav'echen virti adem!
Yennefer," Geralt, watch out!"
Geralt, Great.
Geralt, What was that?
Yennefer, Unicorns.
Geralt," Dammit, Yen, I saw the foglets. I mean how'd they get here?"
Yennefer, The power of the Mask summoned them.
Geralt, What now?
Yennefer," The Mask reveals the past, but only in certain places. Places where"
Geralt, Ermion says the Mask might cause a natural disaster.
Yennefer," Fortunate he's here then. He can jump right in, try to tame it."
Geralt, Realize he won't let this pass?
Yennefer," Oh, I'll survive, somehow."
Geralt, Want me to wear it?
Yennefer, Yes. I'll cast a spell that will let me see through your eyes.
Geralt, Gonna read my mind again?
Yennefer, You object?
Geralt, You do it whenever you want anyway.
Yennefer," No harm in it then, is there? Let's go."
Geralt, You know I don't like it.
Yennefer," Let it go. I just want to see what happened. Besides, you know"
Geralt," Well, let's go."
Yennefer, This way.
Yennefer, Already found the first spot.
Yennefer, This is the spot. Put on the Mask.
Geralt, Any instructions?
Yennefer, Keep it on until we've seen everything. And don't stray far.
imprint, an open portal
Geralt, What's that? A portal?
Yennefer, Two people emerged from it.
Geralt, The woman was Ciri.
Yennefer, How can you know?
Geralt, The way she moved. Like a witcher. Seems they went that way.
Yennefer," Come, let's find the next spot."
Yennefer, Well? Ready? Use the Mask.
Yennefer, Watch out!
Geralt, What was that?
Yennefer, Hmm... A magic explosion of some sort. So powerful even that echo was
Geralt, But Ciri and her companion weren't harmed... I saw them escape.
Yennefer, Let's see where to.
Geralt, Place is creepy. Don't like it.
Yennefer, Nor do I.
Geralt, Anyone here when this happened had a slim chance of surviving.
Yennefer, I know what you're thinking... But don't worry. Ciri can take care
Yennefer, Don the Mask.
Geralt, Someone chased Ciri. See that? Might've wounded her.
Yennefer, She escaped. Through another portal.
Geralt, Know where it led?
Yennefer, Magic residue trail leads to...Velen.
Geralt, Any chance you can figure out where Ciri's companion fled to? His
Yennefer, I'll try to find it. Come.
Yennefer, Well? Ready? Use the Mask.
Geralt, Nice fight.
Yennefer," One repelled with powerful magic, then fled through a portal."
Geralt, A mage?
Yennefer, Most likely. It's Ciri's companion and the one who wounded her.
Geralt, How do you know?
Yennefer, I don't. Making an educated guess. They both appeared in the previous
Geralt, Ciri's got a powerful ally.
Geralt, May be something left of the one who got hit by the spell.
Yennefer, It's clearing up.
Geralt, Ermion must be getting a handle on the weather.
Yennefer, Which means he'll be free to attack us again.
Geralt," The mage who was with Ciri fled, too. Know where?"
Yennefer, Hmm... His trace path leads to Velen as well... But the target
Geralt," Hm, ran into Keira Metz in Velen. Coincidence maybe, but... She"
Yennefer," Hmm... Whoever he is, he grows more interesting by the minute..."
Ermion, Are you pleased with yourselves?! Look at what you've brought down on
Geralt, Just so happens I'm willing to do anything for some people.
Ermion," Everyone else, everything else be damned, is that it?!"
Geralt," Relax. Storm's died down, you've clearly got things under control."
Ermion, For now! But who knows what will be a week or two on!
Yennefer, Stop panicking! Here's your Mask.
Ermion, It is worthless. It's an unwieldy ashtray at best. I hope you've
Yennefer, Very.
Ermion, I'm talking to Geralt. You... You I'll deal with later. So?
Geralt, Got a feeling we've found something interesting. Just need to examine
Yennefer, In the vision he went flying in that direction.
Geralt, We think a powerful curse was cast here.
Ermion," Hmm... Plausible, considering what happened to the wood. Do you know"
Geralt, Not yet. But we know Ciri was here. She stepped out of a portal. A
Ermion, Where to?
Geralt," Velen, probably -- the mage opened a portal for her. Then he fought"
Ermion, Yes? Is that it?
Geralt, Something's pinned under that tree. Can you...?
Yennefer, I can.
Geralt," Armor's clean -- no blood, no sword nicks. Ciri's friend must've..."
Yennefer, Vaporized him.
Ermion," Exquisite, the armor... Though the workmanship's unfamiliar. Can't"
Geralt, Probably because it belonged to a rider of the Wild Hunt.
Ermion," What?! So it's true...the Wild Hunt...I feared as much. First here,"
Yennefer, They're looking for Ciri.
Ermion, But...why?
Geralt," It's a long story that involves the Elder Blood, Ciri's abilities..."
Ermion," Did she, perchance, inherit her mother's skills?"
Yennefer, Ciri can do much more than her mother could. But right now we're
Geralt, Elder Blood flows in Ciri's veins.
Ermion, Hmm... 'Tis true she can trace her lineage clear back to Lara Dorren
Yennefer, Ciri's exceptional. She travels between places -- here and other
Ermion, Huh?
Geralt, Which is why the Wild Hunt wants to capture her.
Geralt, Speaking of the Wild Hunt -- mentioned it appeared on Hindarsfjall.
Ermion," Well, it happened at least a fortnight after the cataclysm struck here"
Yennefer, Anyone survive?
Ermion, A dozen or so women and an old man.
Geralt, Next stop -- Hindarsfjall.
Yennefer, I'll meet you on the beach near Lofoten.
Geralt, Wait. Can't we go together? Right now?
Yennefer, But you detest being teleported.
Geralt," Don't exactly like potions either, but I drink 'em when I have to."
Yennefer," Mhm...you also drink them when there's no need at all. Very well,"
Geralt, Mhm. See you there.
Ermion, Good luck to you. Inform me once you've learned anything new.
QUEST, IN CIRI'S FOOTSTEPS (SKELLIGE) |_
Geralt," Greetings, Yen."
Yennefer, Good thing you're here... The frostbite was starting to set in.
Geralt, You should've dressed warmer.
Yennefer, Mhm. Next you'll be pinning mittens to my coat. Can we go?
Geralt, Yeah.
Geralt, Had a matter to tend to.
Yennefer," A matter that brooked no delay, I presume... What was it? A nekker"
Geralt, Something like that. Can we go?
Yennefer, Mhm.
Yennefer, Quite a few years since I was last on Hindarsfjall. But if I remember
Yennefer," Razed huts and fresh graves. Hm, this must be it."
Geralt, Gathering of some kind... We've come at a bad time.
Yennefer, There's no good time to talk about the Wild Hunt.
Geralt, Ritual of some kind... We'll have to wait.
Yennefer," We'll do no such thing. Dear sisters... Pardon the interruption, but"
Woman, Can you not see we're commemorating the dead? So...
Yennefer, And we're looking for someone who's still alive. Please... This is
Woman, Ugh. Then speak.
Geralt," We're looking for a young woman, name of Ciri. Ashen hair, green"
Woman, I'm sorry. She is not here.
Woman," Unless she lies in a grave... That is, I do not recall one by that"
Geralt, They say the Wild Hunt destroyed this village...
Woman," That is true... Though few believe us. You don't either, I'm sure."
Yennefer, Did you see riders on skeletal horses? Wearing frost-covered armor?
Woman, Aye... That's how it was... They landed on our shores in a ship made
Woman," You were to ask about someone, not prod their wounds. That's enough."
Yennefer, What happened then?
Geralt, Go on.
Woman," I ran out... To get help, to get Leif... But... So many bodies. Jole,"
Yennefer, Which way did the riders go?
Woman, Towards the sea... Through the ravine...on horses made of bones...
Woman, Enough. Get to the point. Now.
Geralt, Yen... Leave her alone.
Yennefer, You don't understand. If we can learn where--
Geralt, I understand. And I'm still asking you to stop.
Yennefer, You're right.
Woman, Get to the point. Now.
Woman," This... This Ciri... Has she a scar? Here, on her cheek?"
Yennefer," Yes, yes. What happened to her?"
Woman," Don't know. Saw her for a moment, right before...before it all. She was"
Woman, A thousand curses upon him.
Geralt, This Craven you mention... Does he have a name?
Woman, He did... Until the elders struck him from the Saga of Ancestors.
Woman, It's as if he has ceased to exist. The law forbids anyone from
Yennefer, What did he do to deserve that?
Woman, He fled from the Wild Hunt... He alone!
Geralt, We need to talk to him... Even if it's not in keeping with your

Woman, Only that she seeme tired. Very tired. And...and her hair was wet.
Yennefer, Great. So we know she bathed. Progress.
Woman, I'm sorry. Skja--
Woman, Craven.
Woman, My apologies. Craven. Craven could've told you more.
Woman," You've come too late. He went to the garden, to fight Morkvarg."
Geralt, Morkvarg? What's that?
Woman," Who, you mean--"
Woman, The vilest man ever to inhabit Skellige. Nothing was ever sacred to

Geralt," I can get rid of Morkvarg. Don't know what he's turned into, but a"
Woman, It's not that simple. There have been those that bested Morkvarg...
Geralt," So, it's a complex curse... Meaning I need more information."
Woman, I understand... But I've told you all I know.
Woman," Speak with Toradar's son, Einar. He was in the garden when Morkvarg"
Geralt, I'm not here to work.
Yennefer, I doubt Morkvarg cares. Monsters prowl when they will and where
Geralt," Fine. He comes within reach of my sword, I'll deal with him... But"
Geralt, Where is this holy garden?
Woman, Not far from here... North. We cultivated healing herbs there once...

Geralt, Worried this trail might've gone cold...
Yennefer, Even if Craven's dead... We'll manage.
Geralt," How, exactly?"
Yennefer, You'll see when the time comes.
Geralt, You could stand to be nicer sometimes.
Yennefer," I suppose...but then I wouldn't be the woman you fell in love with,"
Yennefer," My, my... That must be Morkvarg... Quite the appetite."
Geralt, Mhm. Might even call it wolven...

Yennefer, He doesn't seem happy to see us.
Geralt, Wait till he gets a closer look at me.
Yennefer," So, where shall we start?"
Geralt, Let's go to that tree the sisters mentioned.
Yennefer, Plan to bleed yourself for the goddess?
Geralt, Not necessarily. But Craven did... We might just pick up his scent.
Geralt, Craven was here. Look...the impression -- kneeled down on one knee...
Yennefer," No... I may be inhumanly beautiful, but I don't have supernatural"
Geralt," Which is why you should stay up here. No offense, but in that"
Yennefer, Ball and chain?
Geralt," Planned to say it gentler, but yeah, that's basically what I had in"
Yennefer," Fine... We'll do as you say. If the need arises, I can cast spells"
Geralt, Fine... See you later then.
Yennefer," Don't get hurt. Remember, I need you if I'm to find Ciri. Oh, come"
Geralt, Mhm. Better.
Geralt, Thought you might object...
Yennefer, Me? Please. I can be extraordinarily conciliatory.
Geralt," Yen, look me in the eye... What're you plotting?"
Yennefer," Many things... How to seize the Temerian crown, how to sell Kaer"
Yennefer, Is it Craven?!
Geralt," No, this one's been here a while!"
Yennefer," What?! I can't hear you! If you want to chat, come closer!"
Geralt, Her senses are really dulled...
Yennefer, Well? What is it?
Geralt, Whaddaya know about this garden?
Yennefer, Let me think... That it's dreadfully overgrown.
Geralt, Had its history in mind.
Yennefer, They say Freya herself planted it. When the world was young the
Geralt, You believe that?
Yennefer, Is that a serious question? Of course not. Favorable microclimate
Geralt," To transform into a werewolf... It's a dog's life, eh?"
Yennefer," Well, there's not a youth out there who doesn't have a wolf in his"
Geralt, Then the curse confined him to this garden? Couldn't really cut his
Yennefer, No question he was top dog here...
Geralt, Just wolfin' things down...or not.
Yennefer," Geralt... That's enough, hm?"
Geralt, Fine. Still had a few good ones on the tip of my tongue.
Yennefer, I'm sure you did. We'll say you won.
Geralt," I found a corpse...not Craven's, though."
Yennefer, Aha. And you thought I'd find this interesting because...?
Geralt, Because...no bite marks on it... Doesn't seem strange to you?
Yennefer," Zerrikanian cuisine, Dandelion's fame and shoes with curly toes"
Geralt, Reading between the lines here -- think I'm wasting your time?
Yennefer, I mean merely that we should focus on what's most important at the
Geralt, All right. Going back down.
Yennefer, Be careful.
Geralt," Can't cross that... Gotta go down, provided I can open the sluice."
Yennefer, Geralt! You scared me!
Geralt," Sorry, didn't mean to."
Yennefer, I hope not! Let me know once you find Craven!
Geralt, Damn... Dead...has been for a while. Yen! Found him!
Yennefer, And?
Geralt, And I've seen rotfiends in better condition than this.
Yennefer," Shit... Fine, scrape together what you can and haul the bits up here!"
Geralt, Yen...there's no point...
Yennefer, There's no point in discussing this through a grate!
Geralt, Take it you've got a plan?
Yennefer," No, I just like to stare at rotting flesh!"
Yennefer," We'll talk when you get here, all right?"
Geralt, That's Yen... Charming as ever. C'mon. Someone wants to meet you.
Yennefer, Putrefaction's set in...but the vocal cords are intact. We might

Geralt, Mhm.
Yennefer, Fine. You busy yourself pouting. I'll handle the rest.
Geralt, Black magic's no joke. Casting those spells never ends well. Never.

Mother, I can't see how you're related to anyone here. No one in Lofoten groans
Ciri, I'm sorry...but I really must go.
Ciri, I suppose...why not?
Mother," Head through the door and you'll see the pier. Be careful, it's"
Ciri, Thank you once more.
Mother," And, once more, there's no need. Gods bless your journey!"
Ciri, Brr... Cold...
Skjall, Oh... You're here... The horses are ready.
Ciri, As am I. Shall we ride?
Skjall," Listen, I...I hope... My sister, she didn't talk any nonsense to you,"
Ciri, No... Except to mention that you fancy me.
Skjall," Wha? But I asked her... Besides, it's not... O' course, y'are very..."
Ciri, I'm not in that much of a hurry...
Ciri," Your first kiss, wasn't it?"
Skjall, O' course it weren't. Argh... Aye. Me first.
Ciri, We don't have much time... But it's enough for you to learn a few
Ciri, You're right. I hope to come back here one day... We can finish our
Skjall, Sounds dangerous...
Ciri, I didn't intend to...
Ciri," I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to chat right now."
Skjall, Right. Besides...it's not important.
Skjall," I'll take Njord, you can ride Grayback. She's old, but she'll make"
Voice, Run for your lives!
Skjall, You stay here! I'll go and--!
Ciri, I can look after myself.
Skjall," Ride, Ciri! Don't look back!"
Skjall, What... What was that?!
Ciri, The Wild Hunt.
Skjall, Ragh nar Roog... The world's end...
Ciri, No... Not yet... But I must go. They're here for me.
Skjall, Get on the horse. I'll show you the way to the Rock.
Ciri, I don't know how to thank you...
Skjall, You can thank me once we get there safe... Let's ride!
Ciri," You should stay, see to Astrid, your mum..."
Skjall, Afterwards... Once I'm sure you'll make it. Let's go!
Skjall," Watch out! They're right behind you! Ride, Ciri! Don't look back!"
Skjall, Pull up!
Ciri, What?!
Yennefer, What became of that creature?! Where is he?!
Skjall, Ssss-tooo-pp... Hhh-urrr-tssss...
Yennefer, What?!
Skjall, Sss-aawwww hhhh-iii-mmmm...aaaa-tt...Dddd-ooo-nn-arrr-sss... Bbb-utt...
Yennefer, To whom?!
Skjall, Ddd-ooo-nnn't... Knnn-owwww...
Yennefer, Begone.
Skjall, Ttt-elll...thhhh-emmmm... Ccc-llleeearrr...mmm-yy...nnn-aaa...
Yennefer, Begone I say!
Skjall, Aaaaaach!
Geralt, Yen...let's get out of here. Now.
Yennefer, You needn't ask me twice.
Geralt, What...what happened to the garden?
Yennefer," It died. Like I said... The spell, it requires a great deal of"
Geralt," You knew it would end like this, didn't you? Didn't consider it"
Yennefer," No -- I knew you'd protest. Your sense of dency is charming, but"
Geralt, Yen...are you all right?
Yennefer, I'm fine now. The spell... Imagine putting wriggling cockroaches
Yennefer, I'm splendid. I'll feel even better if I hadn't had to remind you
Geralt, Could've shown some sympathy for the boy. He--
Yennefer," That was no boy, Geralt. It was a hunk of rotting, rancid flesh"
Geralt, Didn't just speak. It howled in pain.
Yennefer, I know it seemed real... But it was no longer human. Do you
Yennefer, Nice of you to be so concerned for the corpse. Much more than
Woman, The garden... Our garden! How could you...? We helped...and you --
Yennefer," Now, now..."
Woman, Don't you dare try to calm me. We've every right to be furious. And
Geralt, We had no choice. We'd never have learned what happened to our--
Woman, Do you really think you're justified?! That your hunt for a foreign
Yennefer, I'm sure it doesn't in your eyes.
Geralt, I'm sorry.
Woman, Is that all? Will you say nothing else?
Geralt, Nothing that would help.
Woman, I shall make sure all of Skellige hears what you did here.
Yennefer, Wait...I did this. I alone. Geralt tried to stop me...I refused to
Woman, I might have known. They warned me about you...
Woman, Sorceresses...
Woman," None shall open their door to you, none shall feed your hunger, and none"
Geralt, Yen...you didn't have to do that.
Yennefer, But I wanted to. I'd rather not talk about it. We must focus on what
Geralt, Didn't learn much. Though...though we can be sure Ciri's not in
Yennefer, Perhaps we should reexamine what we've learned. We might've
Geralt, Certainly hope that's the case.
Yennefer, Better to have some idea where to look than none.
Geralt, Ugh. Makes me wonder what she's gotten herself into.
Yennefer," Can't even begin to imagine. But we will pull her out of it, safe"
Geralt, Key to finding Ciri is that ugly...thing Skjall saw on the beach.
Geralt, You know...I saw something...or someone who looked just like that.
Yennefer, Where?
Geralt," In Velen... Local ruler, a baron, keeps him at his castle. Told me"
Yennefer," You must go and get the creature. I don't know -- buy him,"
Geralt, Won't be necessary. Baron owes me a favor. A big one. The thing's
Yennefer, Grumbling won't get us anywhere. All will be well. A curse?
Geralt, You were gonna ask me something. What was it?
Yennefer, Tell me... Do you think... Is there a chance that thing might be
Geralt, Don't even wanna think about it.
Yennefer, Geralt... We must.
Geralt, Might be... From what I know she was looking to cure a powerful
Yennefer," We must see Donar, ask him to whom exactly he sold the...thing."
Geralt, Not coming with me?
Yennefer, You know...I'm better off not showing myself to him right now.
Geralt, But I'll lose it if I try to deal with that possibility now. We
Geralt," Ciri's trail in Skellige -- we've followed it, exhausted the"
Yennefer," Before you do, there's one thing... It's important."
Geralt, What's that?
Yennefer," Let's meet in Larvik, at the warriors' hall. We'll speak there."
Geralt, Fine. Larvik. See you there soon.
Yennefer, Thank you. For that...and for your help in the garden. I'd not
Geralt, It was nothing.
Yennefer," Geralt, you know me. I'm rare to praise, but when I do, it is"
Geralt," Can we do this later...? Sorry, need to take care of something."
Yennefer," Well, if you must, you must. I shall wait for you in Larvik for a"
Geralt, Ciri's our concern. Ours alone.
Yennefer, Perhaps. But that is not what we agreed with Emhyr. We must see
Geralt," If we gotta, we gotta. So be it."
Yennfer, We'd never have known Ciri had returned if not for Emhyr and his
Geralt, I refuse. Don't have the slightest intention of reporting to him.
Yennefer, Fine... I can't force you.
Geralt, Being awfully loyal to your patron.
Yennefer," He's your patron as well, dear. Don't forget that lest he remind"
Geralt," See you, Yen. Take care of yourself."
Yennefer, Wait. This matter in Larvik -- it really is important to me. I'd
Yennefer, Decided to keep me company?
Geralt, Never know what might come at you deep in a dark forest.
Yennefer," Ugh, witchers. I see you're inclined to respond to the call of the"
Yennefer, You think someone may wish to hurt me?
Geralt, Think I should warn off anyone who'd be dumb enough to try.
QUEST, IN CIRI'S FOOTSTEPS (SKELLIGE) |_
Geralt," Apparently, there was an ugly creature here. Showed up the day after"
Donar, Ah! True! Crawled up from the beach. Gob looked like eels had been
Geralt, You sold him? Did I hear right?
Donar," Aye, I sold 'im. This merchant comes here from time to time. Buys"
Geralt, We were talking about the creature.
Donar," Ah, yes. This merchant -- his eyes lit up as soon as he saw the beast."
Geralt, Where will I find this merchant? And the creature?
Donar, Why d'you ask? Wanna buy him for yourself?
Geralt, Mhm. Looking to train a new witcher.
Donar," Hah! Good one. The merchant... He asked about the route to Novigrad,"
Geralt," Just as likely to be staying there as it is he moved on. Either way,"
Geralt, Didn't know there was a slave trade in Skellige...
Donar," This weren't no human, Geralt. If you'd seen him -- if you'd seen the"
Geralt, Tell me. What's he do?
Donar," Deh, raa... Long bloody story. Suffice to say my hound's wiser than he"
Geralt," Listen, need to broach a difficult topic... A young man from your clan"
Donar," Craven, you meant to say."
Geralt, That's just it. It was unjust of you strip him of his name. He didn't
Donar," Only blood can clear one of shame. Words change nothin'. Not his, not"
Geralt, Need to talk to you.
Sergeant, About.
Geralt, Uma -- gonna take him with me.
Sergeant," Gotta ask the baron's permission. Thing is, he ain't 'ere."
Geralt, Not about to ask for anything. I'm telling you. You can try to stop
Sergeant, Think you got me shakin' in my boots?
Geralt, You sure as hell should be.
Sergeant, Fine. Cripple's not worth no blood. See the groom. He oughta be
Geralt, Thank you kindly.
Geralt, Never mind. We'll talk later.
Geralt, I'm taking Uma.
Man, There ain't a--
Geralt, Got the baron's permission.
Geralt, Sergeant Ardal said I could.
Man," Bring 'im back, though, won't you? Be awful dull without 'im."
Geralt, No. Not about to bring him back.
Geralt," Find something else to laugh at. I dunno, catch some frogs and shove"
Man, Huh. That one of your witcher games?
Geralt, Witcher version's different. Don't make me show you.
Geralt, Open the door. Now.
Geralt," Hey, little guy. This here's Roach. She'll take us to Kaer Morhen."
Geralt, What the...? Quit playing around. Let's go.
Geralt, Uhhh. Looks like we got company. Nilfgaardian battle mounts. What do
Rider, The emperor's displeased with you.
Geralt, Then he oughta ask somebody else for help.
Rider, The emperor does not ask -- anyone for anything. You will ride with us
Geralt, Sure about that?
Rider, Don't even try.
Geralt, Fine. Lead the way.
Emhyr, ...and the Third Army will sweep in from the west and take Ban Gleán.
Morvran," If I may, Your Imperial Majesty... Our spies report that the garrison"
Emhyr," Bribery, then?"
Morvran, We stand to lose exactly no men in battle.
Emhyr," And we stand to lose less time. Very well, give the orders. Then set"
Morvran, As you wish. At once.
Geralt, Your Imperial Majesty... Yennefer...
Emhyr, I did not have you brought here for an exchange of courtesies. Report.
Geralt," As you wish, Your Majesty."
Geralt," No courtesies needed? Perfect. But remember, I'm not your soldier,"
Emhyr, Would you prefer I order my guards? Look around. I need only beckon.
Yennefer, Geralt!
Emhyr, Now report.
Geralt," Ciri... Well, this...man is the key to finding her."
Uma, Ummamamama...
Emhyr," I give you three solid leads, trails as fresh as morning dew, the aid"
Geralt," Listen, I'm looking for a needle in a haystack. A needle that at any"
Emhyr," It's a difficult task, I know this. What of it? Listen to me. I rule"
Geralt," This ""monstrosity"" may well be your daughter. Its body is the product"
Emhyr, Can you lift this curse?
Geralt, I pursued those leads you gave me. Ciri first reappeared in Skellige.
Yennefer," The Wild Hunt tracked them down, found them there. They were forced"
Geralt," Where they were separated. Ciri spent some time with a local warlord,"
Emhyr," Yes, yes. I know my vassals."
Geralt," ...who helped her get to Novigrad, where Ciri crossed some of the"
Yennefer," And into the Wild Hunt, again. Ciri and the elf fled, out to sea"
Emhyr," Hm... The information appears of little use. Though, at least, it"
Yennefer," I've done a great deal of research, made inquiries...but to lift it,"
Geralt," ""Va fail, elaine -- ceàd'mil folie! Gleaddyv dorne aep t'enaid,"
Emhyr," At last, you provide a pleasant surprise. Lady Yennefer, my question"
Yennefer," Yes, I believe I can. But I must--"
Emhyr," The details do not concern me. Geralt, you've achieved precious little"
Geralt, Wouldn't count on that happening.
Emhyr," That was no request. It was an order, Geralt. And I advise you well..."
Geralt, Fine.
Emhyr, This audience is over. Till the next.
Geralt," So, how do we lift Uma's curse?"
Yennefer, We must take him to Kaer Morhen. I'll explain once we get there.
Geralt, Don't worry. We'll ride there. Never did like teleporting.
Yennefer, Take care of yourself.
Geralt, Could've used some of that famous biting wit of yours. Where'd it
Yennefer," I merely know when to indulge my pride, and when I must swallow it."
Geralt," Ah, I see. So you show your claws to me because I'm a lowly witcher,"
Yennefer," Do you really wish to do this now, Geralt? We can fight another"
Geralt," Yen, what happened back there -- in Skellige..."
Yennefer," Please, Geralt. There's nothing left to say."
Geralt, Yen...
Yennefer, No more. Please.
Geralt, Wait. Here. Probably better if you keep it.
Yennefer, Of course. I'm off.

Vesemir," Well, look who the wind blew in! Been away quite a while."
Geralt, Too long.
Vesemir, And your journey -- how was it?
Geralt," Calm, if you don't count the forktail that flew over our heads a few"
Uma, Uuuuummmma...
Vesemir," Hm, what do we have here? Multiple deformities. Eyes, ears, nostrils."
Uma, Uuuuumamamama!
Vesemir," Now, now. Calm down... Yennefer was right on one count... Thing sure"
Geralt, Yen's here already?
Vesemir, And how.
Geralt, Huh... You two argue?
Vesemir," Geralt... I understand she's a -- well, how do I put this?"
Geralt, So where is everyone?
Vesemir," Eskel's hunting forktails. Gotta nip that infestation in the bud,"
Geralt, Mhm. And Yen?
Vesemir, Assembling her megascope. Wanted my help -- running around with
Geralt, So what's Yen planning?
Vesemir, Wish I knew.
Geralt, Mean she didn't tell you?
Vesemir," She told us what she needed to lift the curse, not what she plans"
Geralt, She's up to something...
Vesemir, Glad you noticed.
Geralt, She's gotta have a good reason...
Vesemir," Huh, more than one, most likely... In any case, she's set her mind"
Geralt," Shame, that was a good bed."
Vesemir," Said the same myself. Solid oak frame, down mattress. Triss always"
Geralt," It's either that, or Yen really hates oak furniture."
Geralt, Don't look all that nice yourself. How'd you get so dirty?
Vesemir," Huh? Ah, this... I was mixing some lime for the mortar. Need to"
Geralt, Lotta work for one person. Lambert and Eskel not willing to help?
Vesemir, No. Yennefer's found more important things for them to do.
Geralt, I should let her know I'm here.
Vesemir, If you say so. But... Don't go thinking she'll her arms around your
QUEST, UGLY BABY |_
Yennefer, Gods dammit! You piece of shit!
Geralt, Uh-oh...
Yennefer, Akh akh akh... Damned crystal! Akh akh...
Geralt, You decide to blow us up?
Yennefer," Geralt...I'm sorry, but I'm in no mood for jests."
Yennefer," Geralt, I'm in no mood for jests. Especially dull ones."
Geralt, What's eating you?
Yennefer, Let me think -- that was the...third crystal to explode. It's been
Geralt," The guys...well, they're not exactly happy with you."
Yennefer, Mhm. Why is that?
Geralt, Because...you aren't willing to say what you're planning. You're
Yennefer," I shall explain everything -- when the time is right. First, we"
Geralt," Need to blow off steam? Go ahead, just not on me. Find some other"
Yennefer," Ha, ha, ha. So it's to be dull jokes after all?"
Geralt," Rather have a serious conversation? We can do that, if you prefer."
Yennefer, Would you prefer I take it out some other way? Know what...? We
Geralt, But I'd love to hear what you have to say.
Yennefer, Is that so? Very well then. Listen. You shagged my friend. For
Geralt," Not about to grovel, if that's what you're after."
Yennefer, I tire of this conversation. It ends. Now.
Geralt, Aaaaaaaargh!!!! Whoa... She's really not in the mood.
Geralt, That...was a mistake.
Yennefer, I'm glad you realize it. A mistake engaged in regularly for more
Geralt, Yen... Told you already. I lost my memory.
Yennefer, And I've lost my patience.
Geralt, Aaaaaaaargh!!!! Whoa... She's really not in the mood.
Geralt, If that's what you want.
Yennefer, Knew I could count on your better judgment. Very well... On to
Yennefer," Ah, Geralt... Anything you'd like to say?"
Geralt, Sorry... Pretty dumb excuse.
Yennefer, Extremely stupid. I'm glad a mere whiff of fresh air helped you
Geralt, Mhm. The view from there -- spectacular.
Yennefer," Perhaps I should've teleported you two miles higher. Breathtaking,"
Geralt, Fine... What do I do?
Yennefer," Firstly, help Eskel and Lambert. One was supposed to get me"
Geralt," All right, I'll talk to them. Anything else?"
Yennefer," Yes. There's one other trifling matter. As you saw, my megascope is"
Geralt," All right, how do I find the source?"
Yennefer, Use this potestaquisitor.
Geralt," Potesta... Potestaquisitor? Sounds fancy, complicated."
Yennefer," Yet it's ever so simple. Grasp it firmly, move it around, and the"
Geralt, Mhm...
Yennefer," Spare me your juvenile wit, please. Well? What're you waiting for?"
Geralt," Who you plan to contact? Or is that a secret, too?"
Yennefer, No secret at all.
Yennefer," First off, stop pouting. Second -- no, it's not a secret."
Yennefer, Ida Emean. Remember her?
Geralt, How could I forget. Member of the Lodge... Elven Sage.
Yennefer," Exactly. A Sage. As the name suggests, she should know a great"
Geralt, Hmph... Your sorceress friends -- the sage and not so sage --
Yennefer, If only you'd been this cautious with all of them... But no
Geralt, Hm. You got trust issues with us?
Yennefer," Ugh. No... Actually, I fear you don't trust me. So I'd rather keep"
Geralt, Pretty tortured logic...
Yennefer, It may seem that way now... But you'll understand in time.
Geralt, Heard about the bed... Really prefer to sleep on the floor? Wouldn't
Yennefer," Frankly, I prefer a chill to bedding littered with red hair."
Geralt, So upset about Triss you gotta take it out on the furniture?
Yennefer, Would you prefer I take it out some other way? Know what...? We
Geralt, Ah. So it is about Triss.
Yennefer, Yes. It's about our dear darling Triss. Geralt... I don't want to
Geralt, Agreed.
Yennefer, Splendid. On to more pressing matters.
Yennefer, Ah! One more thing...
Geralt, Mhm?
Yennefer," Thank you, Geralt."
Geralt," Oh, got a signal... Signals growing stronger..."
Vesemir," So, Yennefer found a volunteer to walk around with that chirping stick"
Geralt, Shhh.
Geralt, Ahh. There you are. Disturbance is coming from there. What's in these
Vesemir, Dimeritium bombs. Lambert made 'em.
Geralt," No wonder the megascope doesn't work. All right, gotta get 'em outta"
Vesemir, I can do that. Rather you not make a mess of my shelves. Just keep an
Geralt," Yes, Uncle Vesemir."
Geralt," How goes it? Vesemir's not working you too hard, I hope?"
Uma, Uma.
Geralt, Thought so.
Vesemir, All done. You can go. Now...let's check your conditioned reflexes...
Yennefer, Thank you. Seems to be working now. What was it?
Geralt, Dimeritium bombs. Lambert left them by the beds.
Yennefer, Mhm. I suppose he had no idea they could interfere with my megascope?
Geralt," No, he probably knew... But that's the sort of prank you only pull on"
Yennefer, You don't suppose he--? Lambert? Really? I'm flattered.
Geralt," You know...Lambert's not exactly an expert on megascopes, so--"
Yennefer," Please. Lambert is mean, not stupid."
Yennefer, Enough. Ready for this conversation?
Geralt, Sure you want me here?
Yennefer," But no matter... More importantly, I shall finally be able to"
Geralt, The Ida? Elven Sage? What do you want from her?
Yennefer, Stay and you'll learn for yourself.
Geralt, Members of the Lodge don't let just anyone in on their secrets...or so
Yennefer," Consider it a token of our trust. Now, let's begin. And, Geralt,"
Geralt, Didn't you just say you trust me?
Yennefer, Stop twisting my words.
Ida," Cáed'mil, Yennefer aep Vengerberg. Gwynbleidd."
Geralt," Cáedmil, Aen Saevherne."
Geralt," Hey there, Ida."
Yennefer, Geralt...
Ida," It matters not, Yennefer. I've grown accustomed to human...decorum."
Ida, Why have you summoned me?
Yennefer," We've come up against a curse, one we must lift. It was uttered in a"
Ida, I see... The words of the curse?
Yennefer," ""Va fail, elaine -- ceád'mil folie! Gleaddyv dorne aep t'enaid,"
Geralt, Take it you've heard the words before.
Ida, Yes... In legends. Of the kind that do not end happily.
Yennefer, Can you help us...with the curse?
Ida, To a degree. Agnes de Glanville's incantation combined with Eldar's
Geralt, Recognize the dialect?
Ida, Laith aen Undod.
Geralt, Meaning?
Ida, The so-called One Speech... A forgotten language dating from before the
Geralt, The Migration?
Yennefer," Later, Geralt."
Yennefer," Thank you, Aen Saevherne. Va fail."
Ida, That does not conclude our conversation.
Geralt, Lemme guess...you want something in return.
Ida," If I may, Gwynbleidd, I'd like to request -- stop guessing. Just listen."
Geralt, What is it?
Ida, The Time of the White Frost and White Light is nigh...
Geralt, ...and the world will perish amidst ice. I know Ithlinne's prophecy.
Ida, I don't doubt you know it. But do you understand it? The Elder Blood can
Geralt," All in all, interesting conversation. What now?"
Yennefer, You can start by apologizing for acting like a boor. Despite my
Geralt," I'm sorry. It's just, when Ida started in with that patronizing"
Yennefer, You decided to prove she was completely justified to adopt that
Geralt, Don't really see why I should apologize. I know sorceresses expect
Yennefer, So you refuse to bow and thumb your nose at them instead. Very
Geralt, Any idea what she was talking about?
Yennefer," Ciri, of course."
Geralt, Wish everyone'd just leave her the hell alone.
Yennefer, Wouldn't count on it.
Geralt, What was that about...the Migration?
Yennefer, Good gods! Did they teach you no history here?
Geralt, No. Vesemir figured sword work'd be more useful on the Path. Gonna
Yennefer, Naturally. One's never too old to learn. The Aen Seidhe and the
Geralt, So if Uma's curse was uttered in this Laith aen Undod...
Yennefer," Then it's old. Very, very old."
Yennefer, All is ready. We should gather the others and begin.
Yennefer, Finish whatever it was you and the boys were planning to do... Then
QUEST, UGLY BABY |_
Geralt, What's this? Brewing potions?
Lambert, No. Booze. From potato peels.
Geralt, Mm. For my welcome back feast?
Lambert," Actually, more like my farewell feast... Haven't heard? Madame"
Geralt, Don't sound too thrilled about all this.
Lambert, I'm not. You know the trek to the Circle's no walk in the park. In
Geralt, Lemme go with you.
Lambert, Well... Might have more spring in my step with the famous White Wolf
Geralt, No reason to wait. Let's go.
Geralt, Gotta take care of something. Wait for me.
Lambert, Sure.
Geralt," Realize that monstrosity, as you put it, might be Ciri?"
Lambert, Yeah. I heard.
Geralt, Mind showing a bit of sympathy?
Lambert, I call 'em like I see 'em. That's how I am.
Geralt," Irritating, you mean?"
Lambert, Thought you like people with bitchy streaks.
Geralt, So long as they're women.
Lambert, Then you found the best of 'em. Enough about that. The Circle of
Geralt, Know what? Never mind. Not gonna argue with you.
Lambert," Right, no time to lose. The monstrosity awaits."
Geralt, Lambert!
Lambert," Oh, sorry. The potential Cirilla."
Lambert," Oh, mean to tell you... Can't get to the Circle through the mountains."
Geralt, So we approach from the pond side... Like when we did the Trial of the
Lambert, Exactly. Remember the way?
Geralt," Not easily forgotten, that."
Lambert," ""He who returns with his medallion will prove himself worthy and may"
Geralt, Vesemir ever hear you impersonate him?
Lambert, Yeah. Old man can't stand it.
Geralt, Savolla's breach. Still haven't patched it up?
Lambert," Vesemir'd like to. Doesn't bother me, though. Not expecting anyone to"
Geralt, Shame those Salamandra assassins didn't punch a few more holes in our
Lambert, Or finish the job and reduce these ruins to rubble.
Geralt, Been thinking... We gotta swim across the pond?
Lambert," No, I got a boat there. You know, for fishing."
Geralt, Wow... Never took you for the fishing type.
Lambert," I use bombs. Drop 'em in, then scoop up whatever floats to the"
Geralt, Hm. That makes sense.
Lambert," Well, well. Color me impressed. Where'd you learn them tricks?"
Geralt, It's an art. Learned it from this old master down in Zerrikania.
Lambert, Pfff. Yadda yadda. Save that tale for your next sorceress.
Geralt, Tell me about Vesemir -- things any better between you?
Lambert," Seems so... Old man's dropped the moralizing, and I try not to piss"
Geralt, Mhm. Working out well?
Lambert, Moderately. Castle's pretty big. Easy to stay out of each other's way.
Lambert," Dammit... Moored it right here, I swear."
Geralt, Line must've come loose.
Lambert," Really? Here I thought the boat untied itself, to go for a jaunt on"
Geralt, There a storm before I arrived?
Lambert, Lemme think... Yeah. Five days past.
Geralt," Mhm... Wind must've grabbed the sail, tugged the boat off its mooring,"
Geralt, Water hag...
Lambert, Great. Last thing we needed.
Lambert, All right. Cave entrance is just opposite. See it? Gotta sail across
Geralt," Doesn't seem like such an ordeal now, does it?"
Lambert," No... Still gives me shivers, though. You know only two boys returned"
Geralt," You were the ones who ran into Old Speartip in the caverns, right?"
Lambert, Mhm.
Geralt, Let's go. Jump in the boat.
Lambert," All right. I'm taking the tiller, though."
Geralt, Because...?
Lambert, Cause¹ it's my boat. Not up for discussion.
Geralt, That still gnawing at you?
Lambert, Gnawing? No. Straight old pisses me off. What the fuck was that
Geralt, Oughta ask Vesemir.
Lambert," Oh, I have, many times. Believe you me."
Geralt, Make this boat yourself?
Lambert, Yeah. Something you don't like about it?
Geralt, Besides the water up to our ankles? Nothing.
Lambert, Quit whining... It'll make it across the lake.
Geralt, Provided we don't smash into something first. Barely see the tip of my
Lambert, Never took you for a poet.
Geralt," Oh, but I am one. Wanna hear a limerick?"
Lambert, Sure.
Geralt," Lambert, Lambert -- what a prick."
Lambert, Not bad.
Geralt," Fall off a bit, sail's fluttering."
Lambert, Don't teach your grandma to suck eggs. Right... Almost there.
Lambert, Ready for the caverns?
Geralt, Almost. Before we go inside--
Lambert," Ugh, drink a dose of Cat, I know. Any more words of wisdom? Like ""Step"
Geralt, Sheesh. You're pricklier than Yen...
Lambert, Ugh. Don't fall in love with me. Let's go.
Geralt, Old Speartip's still down there?
Lambert," Yeah, he is -- unless he's done us a favor and keeled over on his"
Geralt, How'd the rhyme go? Old Speartip's a deep sleeper...
Lambert, Wake him up and you'll sleep deeper. C'mon.
Voice, Aaaah! Help!
Geralt, Hear that? Sounds like a kid...
Lambert, You know this valley's uninhabited except for us. Gotta be an
Geralt, What if it's not?
Voice, Aaa... Aaaaaah!
Lambert, Whatever you want to do...
Geralt, We'll investigate. Just in case.
Lambert," You know, Vesemir's right. You do poke the damn hive, almost always."
Geralt, You're probably right... Let's go -- straight to the cave.
Lambert," Finally, something reasonable."
Geralt," Hey, little guy..."
Boy, Aaaaah!
Geralt, It's all right. You're safe now.
Boy, No... No... Help!!!!
Geralt," Fine, consider yourself vindicated. You were right..."
Lambert," Well, well... Whaddaya know!"
Geralt, We can talk about that later. Got the foglets to take care of now.
Lambert, An illusion... Who woulda thunk?
Geralt," You're not gonna let this drop any time soon, are you?"
Lambert," No, I will not. In fact, whole world should hear about the time the"
Geralt," Dandelion should sing about you instead. ""Lambert, the Smart-Ass"
Lambert, Better that than naive. Smart asses live longer.
Geralt," When someone's life may be threatened, I'd rather be safe than sorry."
Lambert, Course. The noble White Wolf never abandons a man in need. He's more
Geralt, Changing subjects... Did I see right? Was that boy--?
Lambert, Yeah. One of ours. Must've drowned during his Trial... Foglets
Geralt, Charming... Let's get out of here.
Lambert," Needn't ask me twice. In fact, I didn't even wanna come here."
Geralt," Lambert, enough."
Geralt, Bones... Pulverized.
Lambert, Mhm. Old Speartip's never been kind to guests.
Geralt, Shit... Too damn high.
Lambert," Not if I give you a boost. Remember? Part of the Trial. ""A witcher is"
Geralt," ""...but even a lone hunter can use a helping hand sometimes."" Vesemir."
Lambert, Ready? Ooooff... You fat fuck.
Geralt," One... Two... Three... You're no feather, either. C'mon, let's go."
Lambert," Hmm... Wall looks a little shaky... Aard, maybe?"
Geralt, Mhm. And wake Old Speartip?
Lambert, What? You afraid?
Geralt, No. I just think before I act. Mind not stomping like that?
Lambert, Relax... I slipped. Ugh!
Geralt, What?
Lambert," Something fell in my eye. A splinter, I think."
Geralt, Hope it wasn't from a broken mirror... That'd make you even nastier.
Lambert," Ha, ha. Oof, place reeks of mould..."
Geralt, What'd you expect? Scent of violets?
Lambert, Would've been nice...
Geralt, We need to be quiet... I could do without a warm welcome from Old
Lambert," Ah, so soft and sweet, just sleepin' there... Makes you wanna make"
Geralt, Lost the element of surprise.
Lambert," Couldn't care less. I'm up for the challenge. You miss me, you"
Geralt, You gonna live?
Lambert, Mhm. Probably.
Geralt, Let's get out of here.
Lambert," Wait. That's for Voltehre, you whoreson. Ptoo!"
Geralt, You finished?
Lambert, Let's move.
Geralt, Voltehre... Who's that?
Lambert," Ya don't remember? Little guy, scar on his chin, right here."
Geralt," Oh, yeah. I remember."
Lambert, All we can do now. Never made it outta here. Let's go.
Lambert, Oof... Good to be back above ground.
Geralt, Mhm... Still trouble ahead.
Lambert," Mean the trolls? They're in for trouble, not us."
Geralt, Dunno who you're trying to impress. Tough-guy stuff's just not
Lambert," Heh, look who's talking. Vesemir told me about that job you did for"
Geralt, Just came out that way... C'mon.
Geralt, We oughta be careful. This is their turf.
Lambert, Couple of trolls got you soiling your knickers?
Geralt," Was bold and brash once, like you. Then I took a pitchfork in the"
Lambert, Hah! See 'im shit and run as soon as he saw us?
Geralt, Mhm. Never known a troll to do that.
Troll," Oooo. Witcherses two, walk no more...stops! This mountain trolly"
Troll, Troll mountain.
Troll, Huh? Ah... Aye. This troll mountain!
Lambert, Ugh... You talk to these idiots.
Geralt, Stay calm... We just wanna get to the Circle.
Troll," Witcherses thing one say, thing two do."
Troll, Thing three do. Sometime.
Geralt, Take my advice. You don't want to mess with us.
Troll, Trolly advice take!
Troll, No... Trolls' advice! And witcherses takes must it!
Lambert," Argh, enough. Outta my way, dimwits, or I'll grind you to gravel!"
Geralt, Mhm. They understood all right. Congrats.
Lambert, Run for the cave...before they stone us to death!
Troll, We rocks throws -- yous go no farmore. Witcherses understanded?!
Geralt, We understanded. But we still gotta get to the Circle of Elements.
Troll," Listen, Butwe. Trolls come no to witchersy castle."
Troll, Rocks lots there. Pretty rock.
Lambert," Enjoying this little chat? 'Cause, er, it's not getting us anywhere."
Geralt, Yeah. Gonna have to agree to disagree.
Lambert, Finally. My brain's gonna ooze out my ears if I have to listen to
Troll, I itsay. No should trusty witcherses!
Geralt, I'm talking. Fact is you know as much about negotiating as they do
Troll, Witcher say hurt no. But before at troll hit! So hit hard big ouch!
Troll," Before throws too trolls. Trolls throws first, witchrses¹ hit then!"
Troll, Witcherses throws on trolls -- ouch... Trolls on witcheres throws
Troll, Troll rock throw... Witcherses strike no back. Just talkie-talkie.
Troll," Dummy you. Witcherses monster kills. Trolls monsters... Yes, true it"
Troll," Hmmm... We do go this. Yous sharp backclubs leave here, yous pass. No"
Geralt, All right. We'll leave our swords here. Pick 'em up on the way back.
Troll, We them want no.
Troll, Ick metal. Mouth stings.
Lambert, You nuts?!
Geralt, Shut up and follow my lead.
Geralt, No way. Witcher without his sword -- it'd be like losing an arm.
Troll, Better arm lose than head!
Lambert, Think you might've missed your calling.
Geralt, Hm?
Lambert," If I remember Pappy Vesemir's lessons correctly, witchers kill"
Geralt, Your memory's shit. They only kill harmful monsters.
Lambert," They threw stones at us, Geralt."
Geralt, Whine about it to Eskel later.
Lambert, Just...a few steps more...and we're there.
Geralt," Oo, that's some serious panting. Out of breath, out of shape."
Lambert, Nah... Just a bit...hung over.
Geralt, Been hitting the hooch with Eskel again?
Lambert, No... Been hitting it alone...
Geralt, Well... We made it.
Lambert, No denying that. Damn... Beautiful view.
Geralt, Must be if you noticed it.
Lambert," Geralt, who do you take me for?"
Geralt, Lemme think...a sourpuss?
Lambert," Hah! Fair enough, but save the rest of your compliments for later."
Geralt, We can soak it in later.
Lambert, Of course. Duty before pleasure.
Geralt, Remember how this Circle works? Been a while since I activated my
Lambert," It's fine, old man, no need to make excuses. Light the torches and"
Geralt, All right... Phylactery's in place.
Lambert, Then all we gotta do is wait. The container'll absorb the Power of
Geralt, Lemme think... Oh yeah. Used Axii. But I only had to get past one
Lambert," Yeah, useful sign, Axii. Saved my life a short while ago."
Geralt," Yeah, Axii's useful...and dangerous."
Lambert, Hmph. What makes you say that?
Geralt," It tempts you to overuse it. Force a merchant to reduce his price,"
Lambert, I don't. Life's too short.
Geralt, Sense a good story coming...
Lambert, One of the best. A couple of road robbers stopped me -- one pointed
Geralt, Didn't have to kill them...
Lambert," But I could, so I did. Two whoresons less in the world. Big deal."
Geralt, Wow...truly great story.
Lambert," Isn't it? Real side-splitter, I think."
Geralt, Tell me... You always been such a cynical bastard?
Lambert, No. I was adorable before Vesemir brought me to Kaer Morhen.
Geralt, Think it's that bad being a witcher?
Lambert, Guess I could've been someone worse... Just a shame I had no choice.
Geralt, We all went through it...
Lambert, That's just it -- not everyone made it. Lots of boys died here.
Geralt, It was our destiny...
Lambert, Destiny? Let me tell you about destiny. My dad was a drunk. He'd knock
Geralt, Didn't know... I'm sorry.
Lambert," Next time you wonder why I'm so bitter...well, there's your answer."
Geralt, Know what... Let's get outta here.
Lambert," Don't like what you're hearin', huh? Witchers shouldn't talk like"
Geralt, Lambert... Please.
Lambert," Thought we were opening up, having an honest talk... But fine, let's"
Geralt, Need to get our swords. Witcher with no sword's like a man without an
Lambert," Sure thing, brother."
Troll, Witcherses sharp backclubs takes. And home goes.
Lambert," Mhm. Don't worry, I don't need convincing. Come on, Geralt. Let's go."
Geralt, Right. Let's get back.
Lambert," After you, sir."
Geralt, You go ahead. Gonna stay here for a bit.
Lambert," Mhm. Not too long, though. Remember, we¹ got ourselves a cripple to"

Eskel," Geralt, please... Cut the crap."
Geralt, Looks aren't everything -- certainly not to all women.
Eskel," You're right... But most like a full purse, too. Don't have much to"
Geralt, You too. How are thing?
Eskel," Same ol', same ol'. Another day, another drowner."

Geralt, Bit of exercise'll do you good.

Geralt, Well...you've rounded out a bit... Still got some of last winter's

Geralt, No...don't think so.
Eskel," Saved this lost knight once... You know, woods, dark, wolves. The"

Eskel, Mock me all you want. You're just jealous.
Geralt, Bleeding heavily...
Eskel," De ole hen she cackled, she cackled on de fence... De ole hen she"
Geralt, What's that song?
Eskel," Some old hill-folk tune, perfect for hiking... My mom sang it to me."
Geralt, You remember her?
Eskel, Just that silly song. Nothing else.
Geralt, Landed here.
Eskel," Not very gracefully, look at the tracks. We broke its wing, I think."
Geralt," Fled to its lair, looks like."
Eskel," Good. Means it's done fleeing, gonna make a stand."
Eskel, All right. Let's collect the spinal fluid and get outta here. Cut into
Geralt, Gonna tell me which side of the knife to cut with next?
Eskel," The sharp one. C'mon, hurry up."
Geralt, Yen tell you why she wants this?
Eskel," Mean you don't know? And that, uh...doesn't bug you?"
Geralt," Course it does... Don't see us lifting the curse without her,"
Eskel, We could've gone to Triss for help.
Geralt," Put it to you this way... If Yen can't help Uma, we can always go to"
Eskel, Oof... There'd be hell to pay.
Geralt, Exactly. Enough of this talk. Let's go.
Geralt," No, it doesn't. I trust her."
Eskel, And they say people learn from their mistakes...
Geralt, What was that?
Eskel," Nothing, nothing."
Geralt, Great. Let's go.
Geralt," Something about Yen bothering you? C'mon, grow a pair, give it to"
Eskel, You grow a pair and admit she tricked you. More than a few times.
Geralt, That was then. Yen's changed.
Eskel," Right. Fine, never mind... Let's go."
Eskel, Hey. Whaddaya say to a little race? Maybe see who's faster -- Roach or
Geralt," Not really a challenge, 'cause I could beat you riding a lame sow..."
Eskel, You're a lame sow yourself. First to Kaer Morhen wins!
Geralt, We shouldn't. Rather not tire out my horse for no reason.
Eskel, Ah... Honestly can't see what all those dames see in you. You're a
Geralt," Pretty damn handsome stick, though."
Eskel, Debatable... Let's go.
Geralt, Finally. Took you a while.
Eskel, Saddle kept sliding...
Geralt, Mhm. Not a crappy show dancer out there who doesn't blame her shoes.
Eskel, You're a fucking show dancer -- but one who's damn good on horseback.
Geralt," C'mon, not gonna take anything from you. Buy me a round some time and"
Eskel, Done deal.
Geralt, Since you insist...
Eskel, Here. Use it wisely.
Eskel," ""I could beat you riding a lame sow""... Good one."
Geralt, Underestimated you... Or should I say Scorpion. One fast mount.
Eskel, And I overestimated you. If I'd known it would be that easy I'd 'ave
Geralt, All right. Name your prize. Earned it.
Eskel, Hm... Had this craving for Mahakaman spirit a while now. Nothin' burns
Geralt," As luck would have it, got a bottle with me... Here."

Geralt," Nah. Enjoy a swig from time to time, just like you."
Eskel, Right... Vesemir used to say he couldn't tell us apart. Like
Geralt, Have a bottle for you next time we meet. Promise.
Eskel, Hold you to that.
Geralt," Bet you next time. Thing is, I'll win."
Eskel, Yeah. Sure.
QUEST, UGLY BABY |_
Geralt, Got you everything you need.
Yennefer," Splendid. Lambert, prepare the apparatuses. Eskel, go--"
Vesemir," Last I heard, my dear, I give the orders around here. Not you."
Yennefer, I believe we made an agreement. To seek to cure Uma my way.
Vesemir, I said we would help you. That's it. I don't know what you want to do
Vesemir," Just as I thought. Which is why I think we should first try another,"
Geralt, What's this method?
Vesemir," Derives from folk traditions. I've used it many times, in 1211, to"
Geralt," Don't take this the wrong way, Vesemir, but clock's ticking."
Vesemir," I ask only one night's delay. If nothing comes of it, we'll do what"
Vesemir, I'll take Uma into the mountains.
Yennefer, What then? Will you howl at the moon together?
Lambert, A bit of respect. You're not talkin' to Geralt.
Vesemir," No, we will not howl at the moon. I'll lay him down on a grave stone."
Yennefer, In my opinion--
Vesemir, I know your opinion. But I'm not asking anyone's permission. I'm
Geralt, So...got the evening off. What do we do with it?
Eskel, Vesemir mentioned some roof beams in the tower need replacing. Maybe
Lambert, Sounds a lot better than the beams.
Geralt, Wouldn't mind a shot myself. Or two.
Eskel, Nothing I can do -- been outvoted. Let's go.
Geralt, Vesemir's gotten a bit grumpy in his old age.
Eskel, That was nothing. Shoulda been here last winter when Lambert tried to
Lambert," What good's this old ruin anyway? Moldy walls, leaky roof, and it's"
Eskel," Vesemir didn't say a word. Stood, grabbed his sword, and slammed the"
Yennefer, Do as you will... But in a moment. Geralt and I must talk.
Eskel," Oo, sounds serious. C'mon, Lambert... See you in a bit Geralt."
Geralt, All right. What'd I do this time?
Geralt, Something not quite right?
Yennefer," No, nothing. I just wanted to take you aside...without cluing the"
Geralt, Mhm... And what are we up to?
Yennefer, Sneaking upstairs to make love.
Geralt," Wow, you don't exactly mince words..."
Yennefer, I'm too old to play the blushing bride... Unless you ask nicely.
Geralt, Or three...
Yennefer, I'll hold you to that.
Geralt," Yen... Don't get mad, but--"
Yennefer," Stop. Suddenly, I've an immense desire to drink."
Lambert, So? Head Sorceress box your ears again?
Geralt, You could say that.
Lambert," Well, well... Lovebirds decided to join us. Enjoy yourselves?"
Eskel," You heard the answer to that question, Lambert... Besides, not our"
Eskel," Uh, Yen, we don't have glasses. You all right drinkin' from a mug?"
Yennefer, I'd drink from an old boot tonight.
Yennefer," Urghgh... Perhaps instead of getting crocked in a deep glum, we could"
Geralt," Eventful times for me, recently. Kings, dragons, conspiracies and,"
Lambert, We're thrilled for you. But why don't you tell us about Uma instead?
Geralt," What've you been up to, Lambert?"
Lambert," Uh, yeah. Contract in Lan Exeter. Not to boast, but a pretty"
Eskel," Yeah, Kovir's where the gold's to be made. Know how much they pay"
Lambert," Shush, I'm talking now. So this giant was giving 'em trouble."
Yennefer," ...and relieving himself on the highway, rendering it dreadfully"
Lambert," Fine. Turns out it wasn't a giant, just a fat forest troll. And a"
Geralt, What did you do?
Lambert, Killed the bandits to keep the roads safe. Then I killed the troll.
Geralt, Pragmatic as ever...
Yennefer," You could stand to show some of Lambert's expediency, set ideals"
Lambert, Knew the sorceress would see it my way.
Geralt, Could've spared the troll...
Lambert, Pff. To eat roots and sleep in roadside ditches? I needed the coin.
Eskel, Let's raise a mug to his memory -- the least we can do.
Geralt," Where'd you go while you were away, Eskel?"
Eskel, Aldersberg. Hunted a higher vampire.
Lambert," Oh-ho-ho... Dangerous whoresons, those."
Eskel," Finicky, too. Specimen in question only went for young women from the"
Lambert, That's like me.
Yennefer," We've no interest in your fantasies, Lambert. Whereas the vampire"
Eskel, My client threw a masquerade ball for the city's notables -- to lure
Geralt, What about the vampire?
Eskel, I'd made a deal with this young alchemist. She really loaded up --
Yennefer, Hm... A fairy tale on gluttony for modern times.
Geralt, Alchemist come out of it all right?
Eskel," Fine. Lost a bit of blood, I suppose. Hangover was the worst part."
Geralt, Mixing work and romance? Bad idea. Vampire coulda caught you with
Eskel," Suppose so. But you look the way I do, you gotta grab every chance"
Lambert," Hahaha, maybe you should wear a mask permanently."
Eskel, Huh! And maybe you should wear a gag.
Geralt," Pff. Long story. I was on Ciri's trail -- went to Velen, Skellige,"
Eskel, He get caught ploughing somebody he shouldn't 'ave been?
Lambert," Right. Speaking of old friends, Novigrad and ploughing... How's Triss?"
Geralt," Fuck off, Lambert."
Lambert," Whoa! Hit a sore spot, I guess."
Geralt," We were talking about Uma, weren't we?"
Lambert, The night is young. Got time to talk about everything.
Geralt, Triss is...managing all right.
Lambert, How're those scars she got at Sodden? Still there?
Eskel, Lambert. Not funny.
Lambert," Fine. Conversation turned serious? Let's talk. Yen, what do you plan"
Yennefer, I said I'll tell you tomorrow.
Eskel, So tell us now. It's after midnight.
Yennefer, I'll subject him to the Trial of Grasses. But only--
Lambert, You'll fucking what?!
Geralt," Mind your manners, Lambert."
Lambert, Did you hear what--?
Geralt, Not gonna ask you again.
Eskel," Uh, sorry...looking to turn him into a witcher?"
Yennefer," Of course not. As I was about to say, I'll only apply the first half"
Lambert, Because you want to watch him suffer?
Yennefer," Stop interrupting, or I will watch you suffer. To restore Uma's"
Geralt, It'll be the first Trial in years...decades.
Yennefer, I knew you'd be wary.
Geralt, What are the chances Uma will survive?
Yennefer, Not great. But we've no choice.
Lambert, Unless Vesemir can do the trick with his hemlock.
Eskel, Might be surprised. Old man knows his stuff.
Lambert, Wary? That's not the problem. Those secrets have been forgotten. And
Yennefer, I'd be the last to suggest you start producing hordes of witchers.
Eskel," You hardly need to. See, till now we had a great excuse not to take in"
Geralt, Maybe later. Who's up for another round?
Eskel," Oh, I am. But we're all outta stuff to chew on. Geralt, mind raiding the"
Geralt, Not at all.
Yennefer," Gentlemen, pleasure drinking with you...Lambert especially. But the"
Lambert," Heh. Didn't listen, did he?"
Eskel, They never do.
Geralt, What're you talking about?
Lambert, Samovila contract Eskel got a while back. Good story.
Eskel," Finish it in a minute. First, some more fuel."
Geralt, Ooooo.... Now that's a kick in the liver... What is it?
Lambert," ""The Gauntlet"" -- equal parts spirit and White Gull. What's that look"
Eskel, Damn straight! Pour us another. Bottoms up!
Geralt," So, what's this about a samovila?"
Eskel, Snared this peasant in her dance. Instead of bein' happy he escaped
Lambert," Great story. With a moral, too!"
Geralt, Really? What's that?
Lambert, Stay away from dangerous women.
Geralt, Will you ever lay off Yen?
Lambert, Yeah. Soon as I trust her.
Eskel, You'd brave a fire for her... Whereas she plays you like a cheap
Geralt, Listen to you two goddam¹ relationship experts. Neither of you's
Eskel, For good reason...
Lambert," Fine, leave pretty boy alone before he gets grumpy. Already has"
Geralt, You can breathe easy. Yen and I -- we're not a couple. And we won't
Lambert," Ah, explains why the Sorceress Superior was so damn sulky."
Eskel," Lambert, drop it... Sorry, Geralt, that was, uh, insensitive. We"
Geralt, No. I wanna drink.
Lambert, Doable. Definitely doable.
Geralt," All right, change the subject."
Lambert, Cause¹ you refuse to admit I'm right? Whatever. Fine.
Eskel, Stop being a smart ass and pour.
Geralt, C'mon... Let's have some fun.
Eskel, We boring you?
Geralt," No, it's just kinda..."
Lambert," Slow. Pretty boy's right. Listen...there's this game, student from"
Geralt, Hm?
Lambert," Someone starts by saying ""I've never..."" -- and finishing the"
Eskel, Sounds great. You start.
Geralt, How about a round of cards?
Lambert," Why not. Playin' for coin, though, right?"
Geralt, Yeah... Unless you'd rather play strip gwent.
Lambert, Maybe I'd finally come to understand what women see in you...
Eskel, Compare your trouser snakes later. Pouches on the table!
Lambert, Hahaha!
Eskel, What's with him?
Geralt, Don't worry about it. Let's play.
Geralt, I'd prefer to play for pleasure.
Lambert, Pleasure? You should really talk to Yen about that.
Eskel," Got a one-track mind, Lambert. What are you, twelve?"
Geralt, His voice has started cracking. Haven't noticed?
Lambert, Very funny.
Eskel, Very funny! Hahaha!
Geralt," All right, that's enough. Let's play."
Lambert," Huh. So, Geralt, seems to me you got your ass whooped."
Geralt," Unlucky at cards, lucky in love. And vice versa."
Geralt," All right, guys... Bed time."
Lambert, Speak for yourself. Night's still young as I see it.
Eskel," Huh, but we're not... And tomorrow's a big day."
Lambert, Fine... Drinkin' with my mirror image is just no fun. Least it
Geralt, See? Even you can't stand yourself... Good night.
Lambert, I've never...slept with a succubus.
Lambert, How 'bout that!
Lambert," Expected Geralt might've, but you?"
Lambert," Eskel, Eskel... Still waters run deep."
Eskel," I'm a sucker for women with horns. Right, my turn. I've never, after a"
Eskel," Geralt? Lambert's a lost cause, but you... What would Papa Vesemir"
Geralt," Think Papa Vesemir woulda...drank that round, too."
Eskel," Oh, Lambert, Lambert... Kaer Morhen's black sheep..."
Lambert, Wanna know the best part? They weren't even my knickers!
Eskel," All right, Geralt, your turn. I've never...?"
Geralt, ...Taken fisstech.
Geralt, Eskel... Really?
Eskel, Once... With that succubus.
Geralt, ...jumped out a lover's window.
Eskel, That so... Must've been one tough character whose wife you were
Lambert, That wasn't it... He was a friend. Didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Eskel," Yeah, you're a true friend."
Geralt," Right, men, let's end on that. Or else I'll never be able to look you"
Lambert," Brr... Colder'n up an ice giant's ass in here. Gentlemen, I shall"
Geralt, You and Lambert get along?
Eskel, In a way... I've learned not to talk to him about certain things.
Geralt, Guessing that's quite a list.
Eskel, It is.
Geralt, Gotta say I'm pretty warm...
Eskel," He's always been a wuss about the cold. Remember winter, fifteen"
Geralt," Mhm... Lambert sat by the fire, wrapped in a blanket. Cussed"
Lambert," Hello, young 'uns! Got your own little carnival going, eh? Alcohol,"
Geralt, Where'd you dig up that bonnet?
Lambert, Vesemir's trunk! The height of fashion in 1112! Old man probably put
Eskel," All right, one Vesemir's enough. Take that off before you get it"
Lambert," Oh, I'll pour, Eskel, I'll pour. To the brim. 'Cause without vodka,"
Lambert, Aah... Vodka...vodka's gone. Who's gonna go get some more?
Geralt, Already went...to get food.
Eskel," All right... I'll do it... Kitchen... It's that way, right?"
Geralt, Lambert... Bud... Gotta tell you something...
Lambert, Yeah??
Geralt," Sometimes you're...a real jackass...but...I love you, brother..."
Lambert, And sometimes you're a real blowhard. But dammit...I'd go to hell
Geralt, Lambert... Listen... You... You got a problem with me?
Lambert, Me? Why...why would you say that?
Geralt, Well...just seemed that way. And you know...you're like my little
Lambert, Geralt...dammit! You're gonna make me cry! Come here!
Lambert, Damn... Broke...
Geralt, Good thing it was empty... Eh... Where's Eskel? Shoulda been back by
Lambert, This is a job...for Vesemir!
Geralt, Not again... Take that hat off...
Lambert, Where's that whippersnapper wandered off to? He could be...beleaguered
Geralt," Eskel! Chop, chop!"
Geralt, Spilled some wine...and crawled through it.
Lambert, Had to kneel down to see that?
Geralt," If I'd a' bent over, I'd 'ave puked..."
Lambert, Hey... Hic! You hear that?
Geralt, Sounded like...panting...of a wounded wyvern...
Lambert, Dammit... We missed a fight!
Geralt, Think he...he hurt himself.
Lambert," What's one scar more or less in his case? Makes no difference, as I"
Geralt, Aha... Eskel's close.
Lambert," Hang in there, brother. We're coming!"
Geralt, Heeeey... Look... Here he is!
Lambert," With his ever faithful Lil' Bleater! Hellooo, Eskel! Wake up!"
Eskel, Hm? What? What happened?
Lambert," Got sloshed, stewed and fifty-seven other varities of drunk -- that's"
Eskel," Le' me alone... Gonna puke... The three of us get together, always ends"
Lambert, Let's find a fourth! Better! A woman!
Geralt, None here but Yen... And we don't wanna wake her up. Believe me.
Lambert, What about that sorceress you talked to? Think about it. We turn on
Geralt, Lambert... You're a genius!
Lambert, Course I am! So? We inviting the Lodge to our bash?
Eskel, Fuck yeah! Summon the bitches!
Geralt, Lambert... Believe you've had your last drink.
Lambert, You're just jealous you didn't think of it first... But is that any
Geralt, I don't have the strength to argue.
Lambert," Course you don't, cream puff. Bet I could take you with one finger."
Eskel," Hey... Relax, Lambert..."
Lambert, Wanna fight? Huh? Wanna? C'mon!
Geralt, Good night.
Eskel, All right...how's this work?
Geralt," Well... A twist here, a turn there... Then you gotta say something in"
Lambert, Easy-peasy. Let's do it.
Eskel," Hey. Hang on. When this...Ida sees us...we'll scare her off. I mean,"
Lambert, I know! Yennefer's clothes! Let's dress up. Bags're over there.
Eskel, What's this thing you got for dressing up?
Lambert," Shut it, wiseass, or I'll lace your corset up so tight you'll shit in"
Geralt," Stop whining, Eskel. Times you gotta squeeze into some fr-fr-fr..."
Lambert, Frippery.
Eskel," Uuugh... We don't tell a soul, understand? This stays here."
Geralt," Don't really like the idea, either..."
Lambert," Fine... But if this Ida refuses to talk to us, it'll be your fault."
Lambert, Sure brought a lot of crap... You'd think she was moving in...
Eskel," Shh, you'll scare Geralt..."
Lambert, Yes! Perfect! Like it was made for you!
Eskel, Sure... Soon as I let it out a bit in the waist...
Lambert," Stop talking, get dressed. Not that one... Won't compliment your"
Lambert," Damn, Eskel... You got an hourglass figure..."
Eskel," And you're an ass. C'mon, go, thing's tight as hell."
Geralt," Now... I'll do the talking, you two fiddle with the crystals. Cáed'mil,"
Man, What is this...? Who's that?
Geralt, So sorry... We were never here...
Man, Guaaaaards!!!
Guard," More paper, Excellency?"
Man," No, you oaf! Witchers! Witchers attacking!"
Man," No, you oaf! The Lodge! The Lodge has come for me!"
Witchers, Hahahahaha!
Yennefer, I trust you have an explanation for this. A very good one. Go to bed.
Geralt, Damn... What a dream.
Geralt, See everyone's up and at 'em.
Vesemir," Mhm. And reeking of booze. That hat was a memento, Lambert."
Lambert," Relax, old man. It'll come out in the wash."
Vesemir, Mhm. Take it you had a productive evening?
Eskel, Yes. We talked about Uma. Till late.
Vesemir, So I guess you didn't get a chance to see to the beams in the tower?
Eskel," Uh... No... But we'll, uh, get to that, I promise. Right, Lambert?"
Yennefer, You can give the boys a rap on the knuckles later. Let's get to work.
Geralt," Vesemir, learn anything?"
Geralt, Guess your gravestone and hemlock method didn't work...
Vesemir, Not entirely. But I did learn something interesting¹.
Vesemir," While you were out hunting forktails and playing with the megascope,"
Lambert, All right. I just don't get how that helps us.
Yennefer," Then keep silent. Thank you, Vesemir... And... I apologize for what"
Geralt," Right, so what now?"
Yennefer, We can begin. We need only brew the potions.
Geralt, Thought we got rid of that table ages ago.
Eskel, Huh. Must be fifty years since I last saw Sad Albert.
Vesemir, Couldn't bear to part with it. Thought we might find a use for it
Lambert, Sure. Every grandpa out there's got an attic full of torture
Lambert, Wait. Why couldn't we--
Yennefer, Do it earlier? Because the preparatory potions for the Trial are
Eskel," Oh, no. After last night, I--"
Yennefer, ...and disinfect the tools. Well? Chop-chop!
Vesemir, You don't know who's trapped in Uma's body. How did you figure the
Yennefer, Performed a series of complex calculations... Extrapolated some
Vesemir, Meaning you guessed?
Yennefer, Mhm.
QUEST, UGLY BABY |_
Geralt, Potions ready.
Eskel," Tools, too."
Yennefer, Good. Vesemir...
Vesemir, Hookweed extract to deaden the pain. I know. Done this before.
Yennefer," Eskel, make the incisions in his veins, insert the tubes. Geralt,"
Uma, Umauma!
Geralt, Ready.
Yennefer, Open the valves. It doesn't matter in which order.
Uma, Aaaach... Aaaaaach! Ummmmamamama... AAaaaaa... AAAaaaach!
Uma, Aaaa... Aaaaaach! Aaaaaaaa!!! Ummmmmmama... UUUuuu... Umamama...
Uma, Yyyyyyyyyyaaaaaa!!! Aaaa... Aaaa... Ummmmmmamamamaaaaa...
Geralt, Listen... We should stop this.
Yennefer, Then Uma dies. Very painfully.
Vesemir, Yennefer's right.
Yennefer, Open the next valve.
Geralt, The hookweed work?
Vesemir," If it hadn't, the pain would've sent him into shock, killed him."
Lambert," So, everything's going smoothly."
Vesemir, No... But it's within known norms.
Yennefer, Administer the next potion.
Vesemir, I had hoped... I'd hoped I would never have to watch this again.
Lambert," Why'd you keep the table, then?"
Yennefer, Geralt. Next potion.
Yennefer," Oesi, caefyn!"
Geralt, What now?
Vesemir, Now we wait for the potions to do their work. Might take a day. Might
Yennefer," You need only wait, true. But I must maintain the stabilizing spell."
Uma, Bueeeeergh...
Yennefer," Eskel, I'm sorry... Would you mind...?"
Eskel, Getting some rags? On it.
Eskel, Ugh. I can't believe we're doing this.
Geralt, Wiping vomit off the floor?
Eskel, No. The Trial. If that's Ciri in there...she could come out of this
Geralt, I trust Yen. She knows what she's doing.
Eskel, Don't doubt that. But do we know what she's doing? She tell you how
Geralt," Course I have. Thing is, we don't have a choice."
Eskel," Not any more, we don't. But...we rushed it. Should've started by--"
Yennefer," Gentlemen, the floor's as clean as it'll ever be, and I need to be"
Eskel, Geralt... Maybe you oughta...?
Yennefer," Come now, Eskel. I shan't bite you. Just do it."
Yennefer," No offense, but I'd rather Geralt did it."
Eskel," Understood. I'd prefer that, too."
Uma, Ummmma...
Geralt, That normal?
Yennefer, Yes. Uma's body is disintegrating from the inside. Once that's
Geralt, Hey... Yen... You're dozing off.
Yennefer, No. Just...resting my eyes.
Geralt," Yeah, it's called sleeping."
Yennefer, Then do something to keep me awake.
Yennefer, I don't know... Tell me a story.
Geralt, Pinching's apparently effective.
Yennefer," Mh. Later perhaps. For now, talk to me. Tell me a story."
Geralt, Heard about the time Ciri and I went ice skating?
Yennefer, No... Not that I recall.
Geralt," The winter she trained here. Couple months in, she started"
Geralt, Ever tell you about the time Dandelion bought me a sword?
Yennefer, Was that in Kerack? Just after we'd...
Geralt," Decided to take a break. Yeah. My swords had...disappeared, doesn't"
Uma, Uuuuma...?
Yennefer, He's awake. It's time...time to lift the curse. Prepare the
Yennefer," Nevid, cyvir! Caniatad... Nevid... Cyvir... Coalle... Ariva..."
Yennefer," No...no, I won't let you go! Geralt! Yellow flask! In my satchel!"
Vesemir, Quiet. Listen.
Voice, Coalle... Coalle... Caniatad...
Yennefer," Nevid, cyvir! Coalle, coalle caniatad! Nevid! Ariva! Aendir! Geralt!"
Geralt, Avallac'h?
Vesemir, You know him?
Geralt," Yes. An elf, Aen Elle. A Sage..."
Yennefer, Where is Ciri?
h, Hidden...the Isle of Mists... But...it's not...she's not safe...
Geralt, Isle of Mists -- where is it?
h, Everywhere...and nowhere...
Geralt, The Hunt -- what's it want from Ciri?
h, Her blood... Elder Blood...to open the gate. We cannot...cannot
Lambert," Listen, Sage. We didn't lift that curse to play riddles with you."
h," Praevein, arwein, cyrraen..."
h, In Skellige... Follow it... Into the mists... Hurry... Hurry! I
Yennefer," Enough, Geralt. He's not yet free of death's grip."
Geralt, I'm going to get Ciri.
Geralt, Is he gonna make it?
Yennefer, I can't...know. You saw. Not all went as planned. I lifted the
Vesemir, The Trial has wrought havoc in his body. Violently twitching
Yennefer, Toxins have permanently damaged his nervous system. Even if he
Eskel, Hold up. Don't you think you owe us some answers? How do you know this
Geralt," Yennefer can tell you, just keep an eye on him. He's not a friend."
Vesemir," Perhaps not, but Ciri apparently trusted him. We should at least take"
Geralt, What's your suggestion?
Vesemir, Ciri can't flee forever. One day she'll stumble. And she won't get
Geralt, I dunno. Guess we'll see.
Vesemir," Geralt, you're in a hurry to get her, I understand. But you-- We"
Lambert," You got something in mind, don't you? Come on, spit it out."
Geralt, We'll be waiting for them. Swords in hand.
Vesemir, Yes...
Vesemir, Time we the hunted became the hunters. Geralt will find Ciri and bring
Yennefer, We plan to fight them? We five? In a crumbling castle?
Vesemir, Do we have a choice? Besides delaying the inevitable?
Lambert, Pretty boy could try to round up a few others who know how to swing a
Yennefer, ...or wield magic.
Geralt," Fine. I'll get Ciri, and recruit some allies. Bring everyone here."
Lambert, Any good looking¹ women in that batch?
Geralt, Mhm. Exclusively.
Geralt, And you? What do you plan to do?
Yennefer," I've Avallac'h to care for. He's certain to die without gentle,"
Vesemir, The boys and I'll consider how we should greet our uninvited guests.
Geralt, All right. Time I was on my way.
Vesemir," Good luck, Wolf. And give Cirilla our love."
Yennefer," Come back quickly, Geralt."
Geralt, Firefly's stopped at the hut. Oughta look inside.
Geralt, Locked... Anybody in there? Damn...
Voice, Achoo!
Geralt, I'm not gonna hurt you. Open up.
Voice, Ach! Ye blew our fuckin' cover.
Voice, Who are ye and whaddaya want?
Geralt," I'm Geralt, a witcher."
Voice, Argh. Go away!
Geralt," Looking for a young woman -- ashen hair, scar on her face. Will you"
Voice, No!
Geralt, Running short on patience.
Voice, Wonderful. Means you're about to go the fuck away.
Geralt, How many of you are in there?
Voice, Why d'ye need to know? Ye takin' a bloody census?
Geralt, They call me Geralt. Who are you?
Voice, Ach! It's that witcher! I heard a ballad about this 'un and that
Voice, Shut it!
Geralt, Sorceress' name is Yennefer of Vengerberg.
Voice," Aye, that's it! ""Her eyes flashin' lightnin', her heart an icy"
Voice," By me mum's beard, get yourselves together, lads. You there! Outside"
Geralt, Yeah. Geralt.
Voice," Listen, Geralt. Let's cut to the thick of it. We survived a shipwreck --"
Geralt, Got nothing to fear from me...
Voice, ...Said the fox to the gaggle o' geese. I've lost too many mates
Geralt," This conversation's getting tiring. Listen, let's make a deal."
Voice," If that's a demon, it'll try to dupe us now."
Geralt," I'm not a demon. You don't need to fear me. Gimme a chance, I'll"
Geralt, No way you can get to this isle conventionally.
Voice, Crikey. Ye call a shipwreck conventional?
Voice," Leave it be, mate. Ye know what he means."
Voice, Achoo! Achoo! Let me explain. A short while past we was en route from
Voice, How do ye aim to do that?
Geralt," Say I find your mates, will you believe I mean you no harm?"
Voice," Aye, but I'd not count on either comin' too easy..."
Geralt, How many are there?
Voice," Three: Ivo, Gaspard and Ferenc."
Geralt," Open the door, or I'll open it myself."
Voice," You try! These hinges, this lock -- they'll withstand anythin'!"
Geralt, All right. What do you want?
Voice," I want you to find our mates -- Ivo, Ferenc and Gaspard. They ventured"
Geralt, This Ivo... Where do I look??¹
Voice, Idgit insisted he'd explore the caves to the east. Tried to knock it
Geralt, Gaspard -- where'll I find him?
Voice, He said it was defeatist to sit and wait to be rescued. We had to take
Geralt, Where'd Ferenc go?
Voice, West. In search of a ship that's said to be out there.
Voice," Ferenc, he's, uh, handy. Thought he might fix it up, make it"
Geralt, All right. See if I can't find all three. See ya.
Voice, I'm content ye understand.
Ivo, A man! Hah! Am I ever pleased to see you!
Geralt, I talked to your friends! Come down!
Ivo," Right! I'm comin'! You lucky devil, you. You know, I've one regret --"
Geralt, Dead. Damn.
Geralt," Tried to flee the fiend. Tsk. Stubby legs, too slow."
Geralt," Hey, wake up."
Gaspard," Shoo... Back to bed, Nibbles."
Geralt, Wake up!
Gaspard, Wha-- What's happening? Who-- Who're you?
Geralt, I'm Geralt.
Geralt," Your friends asked me to find you, Ferenc and Ivo."
Gaspard," I'm afeard they're dead. Some horrors swarmed Ivo, saw it with my"
Geralt, Let's get back to the hut. I'll protect you along the way.
Gaspard," Shame about the lads, really, but what can ye do...? Come on."
Geralt, You and your friends -- what's your story?
Gaspard," Rabenick and Company. Real estate appraisal, insurance, mass event"
Geralt, Any chance you've seen an ashen-haired woman around here?
Gaspard," Here? Nay, not a soul. But...a lot passes me by on account of my"
Geralt," Wanna explore the island a bit. Come back for you after, take you to"
Gaspard," I'd only be a burden. You know, the narcolepsy... This place seems"
Gaspard," But, I should warn you, I suffer from narcolepsy, meaning-- Oah..."
Geralt," I know what it means. Don't worry, I'll keep you awake."
Gaspard," Off we go, then."
Gaspard, Driftin off! I'll soon snnnneeeerrr...
Geralt," Come on, get up."
Gaspard," Oh, Nibbles, youse a naughty kitty, aren't ye? All right! I'm up!"
Gaspard, Fle-felyin' a wee bit drowsyyy...
Geralt, Wake up.
Gaspard, Neh! I don't -- don't want to go to school.
Gaspard," Aaaahh... It's stronger than me, so sorrrrrrry... Zzzzzz..."
Geralt, Wake up.
Gaspard," Right, right...just a wee bit longer..."
Gaspard, Know much about this isle?
Geralt, Almost nothing.
Gaspard, Ye know it ain't on my map.
Geralt, A common characteristic of enchanted islands.
Gaspard, Ye think it's enchanted?
Geralt, It's the one thing I'm sure of.
Gaspard, So what is it brought you to this strange place?
Geralt, Looking for someone.
Gaspard, Here?
Geralt, Mhm. Just kind of turned out that way.
Gaspard," Not too keen on talkin' about it, are ye?"
Geralt, Not really.
Geralt, Brought you your friend.
Voice," That so? Let's hear him, then."
Geralt, Wake up.
Gaspard, I'm awake!
Voice," Hahah! Gaspard! Stand back, I'm openin' the door!"
Dwarf, Gaspard! Hah! You seem a bit muddled.
Gaspard," Beh, err, muddled? A bit drowsy, that's all."
Dwarf, What of the others?
Geralt," Found one near a monster's den. He was already dead, sadly. Saw another"
Dwarf, Shit. Rabenick told me to have an eye on the snot. 'Twas his nephew.
Dwarf, Argh. Everything's gone wrong. What'll we do now?
Geralt," Got a boat, you can leave with me. But I need to find someone first."
Dwarf, An ashen-haired lass?
Geralt, Yes.
Dwarf, Oh -- dreadfully sorry.
Geralt, Step aside.
Dwarf," She's cold, spirit's left her. Nothin' we could do."
Geralt, What do you mean?
Dwarf, She's cold. Spirit's left her.
Dwarf, Must've passed shortly before we found her.
Dwarf, Let's wait by the boat.
Geralt, Guess not all of Vesemir's teachings've receded into oblivion.
Ciri," ""A witcher can forget to eat, to drink, to breathe, even, but a witcher"
Geralt," Huh. Uh, yeah, used to repeat that incessantly. Never tired of doing"
Ciri, What creature was it?
Geralt, Huh? Creature?
Ciri," One that gave you the scar over your left eye. It's new, I don't remember"
Geralt, Souvenir from the cockatrice of Spalla. Another addition to the
Ciri, Avallac'h -- he prepared some special ointments for me. But that was
Geralt," We lifted the curse. He's at Kaer Morhen, waiting for you."
Ciri, Are you serious? You must be. You'd not jest about something like
Geralt, Waiting at Kaer Morhen with the others.
Ciri, You lifted the curse?
Geralt," Yeah, tell you on the way. Got a boat on the beach. Once we land,"
Ciri, Right. Conventional means of travel. They're just better. Though a
Geralt," And draw Eredin to us immediately. Rather not risk it. Besides, I"
Geralt, You trust him?
Ciri, Avallac'h? He's not let me down to date. Not once.
Geralt, How'd you ever start traveling with Avallac'h?
Ciri," As soon as I'd left you and Yen on the Isle of Avalon, I found myself"
Geralt, So why'd you return?
Ciri, I thought the Hunt had lost my scent for good. I thought I was safe.
Geralt," The world where Eredin couldn't find you, what was it like?"
Ciri, You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Geralt, Try me.
Ciri," People there had metal in their heads, waged war from a distance,"
Geralt," Ciri, stop fooling around."
Ciri," Told you you wouldn't believe me. Ah, we should've stayed there..."
Geralt, Why exactly is Avallac'h helping you? Sages've never been fond of
Ciri," He doesn't do it for me, it's about my power. As if it could ever be"
Geralt, What's Eredin after? What's he want from you?
Ciri, What everyone wants -- control of my powers. His home world faces
Geralt, Whereas yours will...
Ciri," Exactly. And if I die in the process -- well, that's a necessary"
Geralt," We should go. Got a boat on the beach. Once we land, we'll head for"
Ciri, Right. Conventional means of travel. They're just better. Though a
Geralt," And draw Eredin to us immediately. Rather not risk it. Besides, I"
Geralt," You were looking for us, we were looking for you... Times I thought you"
Ciri, I'm not surprised. There were times I fled pell-mell head first and
Geralt, So tell me how it happened. Step by step.
Ciri, Eredin located us mere moments after we landed on Ard Skellig. Soon
Geralt," That's how Eredin cursed Avallac'h, triggered his transformation into"
Ciri," Yes. He didn't wish to kill him. Humiliation, that's what he was after."
Geralt, And in a full half of a forest on Ard Skellig.
Ciri," Yet it also gave us time to flee. Avallac'h opened a portal, I leapt"
Geralt, But you failed to meet there...
Ciri," Yes, we failed to. Once through the portal, instead of Avallac'h's"
Geralt, I heard.
Ciri," A coincidence, really. I had no desire to hunt that day, but it felt"
Geralt, Boar attacked you?
Ciri, Mhm. Big as a bison and lumbering straight at me. All I had was my
Geralt, Did just fine judging by how the baron's men remember it.
Ciri," Simple soldiers, the whole lot, but we got along splendidly. A shame"
Geralt, So how'd you even meet a man like Whoreson Junior?
Ciri, You and Yennefer were nowhere to be found. And I needed someone who
Geralt," Hm, failed to mention that."
Ciri," Eh, probably didn't want to worry you. Later we learned the Guard did"
Geralt, Whoreson Junior.
Geralt, You suspected right. Whoreson was not the ideal partner in crime.
Ciri, Damned simpleton got it in his head that we'd cheated him and
Geralt, Who you promptly freed only to have to flee to Temple Isle. Great
Ciri," We hadn't planned it, had no time to consider. We just bolted. I"
Geralt, And that's when you landed back in Skellige.
Ciri, The shore of Hindarsfjall -- the first pleasant place that came to
Geralt," Wait, so...you actually wound up there by accident? I thought you"
Ciri," No, he simply sensed me use my power. Just as Eredin can sense"
Geralt, Hmm... Think I know the rest. We should get going.
Geralt, How'd you wind up here? What happened?
Ciri," Last I remember, I was on the Skellige shore, arguing with Avallac'h."
Geralt," What did you dream? I've had nothing but nightmares lately, pretty"
Ciri," Likewise, for the most part. In one, a monster grown from a stillborn"
Geralt, I like that one a lot better.
Ciri," Me too. But these dreams, and the others, ended in some tower. No"
Geralt, Recognize it? Know where it might be?
Ciri," Not sure... I don't think so, but there was something familiar about"
Geralt, Did you?
Ciri," No, dreams all ended with me searching for the entrance. And the last"
Geralt, I was afraid you were dead. Found some dwarves here. Said they'd
Ciri, And yet you came in.
Geralt, Who listens to dwarves these days? Speaking of which -- they're
Geralt," Got a boat on the beach. Once we land, we'll head for Kaer Morhen. On"
Ciri, Right. Conventional means of travel. They're just better. Though a
Geralt," And draw Eredin to us immediately. Rather not risk it. Besides, I hate"
Geralt," Damn... Listen, we gotta think of a way to..."
Geralt, Get us outta here.
Ciri," They'll know where we've gone, they'll know how to find me!"
Geralt," They already do. Ciri, take us home."
Vesemir," Whoa, now. There, there, it's a-- What the--?"
Vesemir," Welcome back, child..."
Yennefer," Ah! Ciri! Haha... My, you've grown beautiful."
Vesemir," No point standing around. Come on, time to greet the others."
Ciri, You've not changed a bit. Any of you... All just like I remembered.
Geralt, What?
NOTE, This always occurs.]
Triss, Little sis!
Vesemir," They're all here, everyone you asked for help. Avallac'h's resting in"
Geralt, Time's short. Wild Hunt'll be here soon.
Geralt," Damn, it's good to see you again."
Yennefer, Would you like a moment to yourselves?
Geralt," Sorry, we didn't mean to--"
Yennefer, I know. It's a simple question. Do you want some time alone?
Geralt, No...let's go. They're waiting.
Geralt, Long as you really don't mind...
Geralt, Seemed to take that pretty well.
Triss, Or wants us to think she did.
Geralt," Haven't been here in a while, have you?"
Triss, Too long. How's the guest room? Anything changed?
Geralt," Mhm. The bed...it, uh, broke."
Triss, Not a problem. We'll sleep on the floor. Spread out a hide and...
Yennefer, Ahem.
Geralt, Guess we should go.
Triss, I-- Maybe I'll give you two a moment.
Yennefer," Triss, please..."
Triss," No, no. You must've missed each other terribly. A minute's delay won't"
Geralt," No, we should get going. They're waiting for us."
Geralt," Fine. So a minute, then we go, all right?"
Geralt, Hmph. This is just a little awkward...
Yennefer, Forty-five seconds...
Geralt, Huh?
Yennefer," We've forty-five seconds left. Well, thirty by now. And then we"
Geralt," Yen, I adore you."
Yennefer, Hm. No points for creativity. But for your candor... Time to go.
Triss," Yen, you know the Wild Hunt better than anyone else. Tell us about the"
Yennefer," Their navigators open portals, rifts that we might counter with"
Triss, There's just not enough of us. It'll be a hard fight.
Geralt, Thanks for coming.
Hjalmar, We've spent our lives preparin' to face the shadows Morhogg.
Vigi," We slew the giant, we'll slay the wraiths as well."
Folan, Aye!
Hjalmar, Imagine we'd miss a chance like this? Never!
Vigi, Cryin' shame Folan ain't with us.
Geralt, Hunt'll be here soon.
Vigi," Tedd Deireadh is upon us. The Final Age, the Time of the End."
Hjalmar, Damn shame Vigi and Folan aren't here.
Folan, So Ragh nar Roog is upon us.
Zoltan," Hah! You found her. They told me the Hunt was after her, that those"
Geralt, Bring all your tools with you?
Zoltan," Thought to myself, a battle approaches. Blades'll need honin',"
Geralt," Thought right. Thanks, Zoltan."
Zoltan, Plan to top that by brewin' some more Mahakaman mix. Shite's so
Geralt, Huh. You seem to be in a good mood...
Vesemir," If they can bleed, they can die."
Geralt, Vesemir.
Vesemir, Welcome home.
Lambert," She's one of us, Geralt. No way we'll let 'em take her."
Geralt, Eskel.
Eskel," Greetings, Wolf."
Vesemir, I certainly hope this gas will work.
Ermion, It shall. We must just ignite it at the right moment.
Vesemir, And that hole...is that there for good?
Ermion," We shall worry about the hole once it is all over. And now, step back,"
Vesemir," Never thought gas could stink so much. We need to warn the others,"
Ermion, I could use a drink.
Vesemir, So could I. We'll find something after the council.
Ermion, Whoever repaired these walls did a shoddy job of it.
Geralt, We're not masons.
Ermion, A shame. We'll not be able to keep the Hunt outside the fortress.
Vesemir," That's no loss. We don't know much about breaking sieges, either."
Geralt, Maybe we can still patch up these holes?
Vesemir, We've got the materials.
Ermion, I can help you if you wish.
Geralt, What about Lambert?
Vesemir," Hm, I know exactly how he'll take to bricklaying."
Geralt, What's the gas for?
Ermion," It's highly flammable. I aim to detonate it, incinerate a few of the"
Geralt, Castle walls won't suffer?
Ermion, The fortress walls are in ruin. They cannot be harmed any more than
Lambert, Still got time to leave.
Letho," I do, but I don't wanna."
Eskel, Think it over.
Letho, I will. I do my best thinking alone.
Eskel, You should have said no.
Letho, None of your business.
Lambert, Wrong -- it is his and mine. Rather not have you behind our backs
Geralt, What is it now?
Lambert, Why did you even bring him?
Geralt, I need Letho.
Eskel," Our opinions count, too."
Geralt, I need anyone who can face the riders of the Hunt in battle. Your
Lambert, You're making a mistake.
Geralt, I'll keep an eye on Letho.
Letho, And I promise to be a good boy.
Lambert," Oh, fuck off."
Eskel," Geralt, this is a problem. Don't dismiss it."
Geralt, Big fight ahead of us. How's morale?
Letho, Remember our encounter with them at the Hanged Man's Tree? We'll thrash
Geralt, An illusion.
Keira," Greetings, Geralt. If I'm to die today, I wish to look smashing for the"
Geralt, Getting all gussied up for the Wild Hunt?
Keira, Women only ever beautify themselves for their own satisfaction.
Geralt, Glad you're here.
Keira, It's good to see you again.
Geralt, Expected you earlier.
Keira," I started off heading in the opposite direction, but then turned"
Geralt, What made you change your mind?
Keira, There are times when a woman should simply not explain her decision.
Geralt," Won't find too many comforts, but try to feel at home."
Vernon, You're here.
Geralt," Thanks for coming, both."
Ves," No need. By the way, it seems you forgot to invite me."
Vernon," Hold your excuses, Geralt. Ves vented on me all the way here, she's"
Geralt, Yes.
Geralt," Quality's what counts, not quantity."
Vernon," A witcher's approach. Works when hunting and fighting beasts, not"
Vernon, I certainly hope you know what you're doing.
Ves, We'll scout around a bit. Need to acquaint myself with the battlefield.
Geralt, Glad to see you.
Vernon," Hmph. Set out alone, Ves tracked me down. Insisted on coming."
Ves, I ought to give you a hiding for not asking my help. But I took it all out
Letho," Ah, some old friends."
Ves, What's this whoreson doing here?
Geralt, We need him.
Ves, You might've forgotten what he did. I haven't.
Geralt, Gotta save Ciri -- whatever the cost. And Letho's faced the Hunt
Vernon, I don't question his abilities. I simply don't trust him.
Geralt, Letho won't betray us.
Vernon," You're naïve, always have been. Usually I don't give a shit, but this"
Geralt, I'll keep an eye on Letho.
Letho," And I'll behave, I promise."
Vernon," Watch this murderer, and you won't be watching the enemy. Why is the"
Letho," Eredin's a king, ain't he?"
Vernon, Fuck you. Both.
Geralt, I'm in command here. I make the decisions. You both know there're no
Vernon," You know what, Geralt? I've done many things in my life I wish I"
Ves, We'll stay and help. But we don't want him at our backs.
Vernon, Elbow higher.
Ves, It's high enough.
Vernon," You drop it a bit every time you release the string. Apart from which,"
Geralt, Get everybody together. Time to talk.
allies," Yennefer,"
Geralt, Thank you for coming. The Wild Hunt'll be here soon. They're coming
Lambert, How do you even know the Hunt'll show?
Ciri," They always know where I teleport to, and they move from place to place"
Lambert, So what's our plan?
Geralt," Eredin, the King of the Hunt -- he's confident, he'll strike hard,"
Yennefer," I'll generate a magic dome over the fortress. It will scatter them,"
Geralt," There aren't many of us, but I'd trust any of you with my life. Work"
Lambert," If they're dispersed out in the woods, we could hunt down small groups"
Geralt, Got our first volunteer for the hunting party. I'm the second.
Letho," Count me in, too. Always believed attack was the best defense."
Yennefer, The Hunt will try to penetrate into the fortress through navigator
Geralt, Lambert'll make us dimeritium bombs. Remember the formula?
Lambert, Course.
Yennefer, Excellent. Yrden should work on the portals as well. I shall also
Triss," I'll look for your signal. Soon as I see it, I'll rain fire on the"
Geralt," Ciri's most important in all of this. The Hunt's after her, and we"
Ciri, What do I do?
Yennefer," Stay inside the keep. If they break through, come inside, we'll all"
Ciri, Out of the question. I can look after myself.
Vesemir," No one doubts that, child. But remember the most important moment"
Ciri," ""Wait for an opportunity."""
Triss," After the council, I'll give you an amulet. If you use it, a ball of"
Geralt," Remember, there's only a few of us. We have to help each other, work"
Geralt, What else do we have that we can use?
Ermion," Do you know we stand on a vast deposit of gas? If need be, I could"
Vernon," Since you plan to ambush the Hunt in the woods, I could dig some"
Vesemir, Meaning?
Ves, Deep as the dark abyss. Bottoms bristling with sharpened stakes.
Zoltan, I brought this Mahamakam mix -- flammable as bone dry saltpeter and
Vesemir, There's a laboratory...and the workshop.
Eskel, One thing to remember -- we've got limited resources and even less
Vesemir, Absolutely. We need to assign one type of weaponry each to the lab
Vesemir, I started brewing some potions. Like to finish if you don't mind.
Eskel, I could prepare more of those witchers' traps. But I'd need all the
Geralt, Always relied on potions. We should brew as many as possible.
Geralt," There aren't many of us, so we'll need to prepare as many traps as"
Vesemir, Let's talk about the workshop.
Geralt, Anyone have any ideas for the workshop?
Vesemir, Been wanting to fix that breach in the wall. But we'll need the
Geralt, Rubble?
Vesemir, Haven't you heard? Roof caved in a couple years back. There's some
Lambert, Filling in the breach seems just as important. They come through
Geralt, Fixing the breach in the wall's a priority.
Geralt, We'll need weapons that can pierce the Hunt's armor. Gotta clear
Vesemir, Let's not forget the laboratory.
Vesemir, We won't have time to do much else. Everything settled?
Geralt," Yes, settled. We don't have much time, so let's get to work."
Geralt," Hm. No, we should do it differently."
Vesemir," What do you want to change, Wolf?"
Geralt, We should use the lab differently.
Geralt, We've always relied on potions. Need to brew as many as possible.
Vesemir, Let's talk about the workshop.
Geralt," There aren't many of us, so we should prepare as many traps as"
Geralt, Oughta use the workshop for something else.
Geralt, Need to patch the breach in the wall first and foremost. Worth
Geralt, Gonna need weapons that pierce the Hunt's armor. Let's clear the
Vesemir, And the laboratory?
Vesemir, Let's sum up: Yennefer will create a magic barrier to repel the main
Geralt," If anything goes wrong, we abandon the outer courtyard, pull back to"
Geralt, Can't help feeling we've overlooked something important...
Lambert, Don't think about it.
Geralt, What's ready?
Lambert," Haven't had much time to prepare, so not much, honestly."
Geralt, Wanted to talk about what we can expect...
Lambert," Thanks, not interested. You should talk to Ciri -- fine mood she's"
Geralt, I'm exposing you all to danger. Unnecessarily.
Lambert, You worry too much. Wipe that frown off your face. We'll make it.
Geralt, Thanks. For everything.
Lambert, Your potions.
Geralt, Can't help but worry. We're short on meteorite steel swords.
Lambert," Got enough for everyone. Here, Vesemir dug this up for you."
Geralt, Thanks. For everything.
Lambert, I'll saddle the horses. Come once you're ready to head into the woods.
Geralt, Takin' Letho with us.
Lambert, You know my opinion.
Geralt, Got a minute?
Ciri, Oh. Serious talking coming.
Geralt," They're after you. No matter what happens, you can't put yourself in"
Ciri, Want me to sit and wait while others risk their lives for me?
Geralt, Listen to me this once -- don't take matters into your own hands.
Geralt," I won't let them take you, you know that?"
Ciri, I know.
Geralt," You gotta keep clear, stay out of trouble."
Ciri, Don't treat me like a child.
Geralt, Didn't even do that when you were one.
Ciri, I like it when you smile. Come here. Everything will be all right.
Lambert, See that?
Geralt, It's starting. Woods! Now!
Lambert, Gonna have to thank Yen once this is all over. That spell -- really
Geralt," Hounds could sniff you out, so don't get too close. And you'll be"
Letho, He always talk this much?
Geralt, Only when he's nervous.
Geralt," Good work with these bombs, by the way."
Lambert," Aim at the portals, be precise. I'm out of dimeritium."
Geralt, Yen mentione casting Yrden at the rifts. Said the sign could seal them.
Lambert, They're here. Time to say hello.
Geralt," Slow down. Element of surprise is key. Stay hidden, give Triss a chance"
Letho, Mean to say Merigold can conjure up more than a cloud of butterflies?
Geralt, Lots more. Wait and see.
Lambert," Next time you get the feeling I'm about to piss off Merigold, make"
Letho, Love these moments. The air before a battle -- nothin' smells as
Geralt, I hate portals.
Geralt, One less to worry about.
Geralt, Problem solved.
Lambert, Geralt! C'mere! Look! They're regrouping!
Geralt, See the commander? Name's Imlerith. I remember him from back when I
Lambert," Damn it, spell's waning. We're becoming visible."
Letho, We gonna try to kill him?
Geralt, Too risky.
Letho, Pansy.
Lambert, What's with Merigold?!
Geralt, Shit.
Vesemir, You were meant to wait inside!
Ciri, I cannot hide forever. I must face them!
Geralt," Back inside, now!"
Ciri, I refuse to sit idle while you risk your lives for me.
Vesemir, Back inside!
Ciri," No! Geralt gave the signal from the woods, and Triss hasn't cast the"
Vesemir, Dammit! All right! Run to her!
Zoltan, Duvvelsheyss! Ciri! Watch out!
Ciri," Hold on, Triss!"
Triss, Ciri! Get back to the Keep!
Ciri, No!
Triss, Give Geralt the signal!
Triss, I'm ready!
Ciri, Dammit!
Lambert, Geralt!
Geralt, Head back!
Lambert, Yennefer's spell is waning! Blizzard's almost at the fortress! Wonder
Geralt, Imlerith? Doubt it.
Vesemir, Large detachment approaching from the woods! We need to close the gate
Imlerith, Ladd nahw!
Vesemir," Lambert! Don't be a hero! Geralt, go to Lambert! Now!"
Keira, Azar! Anatha! Vellos!
Lambert, That was amazing. Thanks.
Keira," You'd never have managed without me, would you? Come, now, admit it."
Vesemir, We gotta pull back! Yennefer's strength is waning!
Vesemir, Heads up!
Vernon, Plough it! Not a second too soon!
Geralt, Get back to your position!
Ves," Zoltan sends his regards, you bastards!"
Vesemir," Fall back! Through the gate, into the courtyard! Check the passage to"
Geralt, Where's Eskel?
Vesemir, Dammit. We agreed he'd open that gate.
Geralt," Hasn't done it yet, means..."
Vesemir, He'll be fine. We've got Triss to worry about now.
Triss, Just in time!
Geralt, Everything all right?
Triss," Yes, thanks. Things were looking shaky."
Vesemir, We had to fall back. They tried to get in through the main gate. I'm
Triss, What's with Eskel? We have to retreat!
Ciri, He's in trouble! I'm going to help him!
Triss, Remember the stone I gave you!
Ciri," See? I can do it, too."
Eskel, I'll take these!
Eskel," Should've stayed in the keep, sat your ass down like you were supposed"
Ciri," Hmph. Who would've saved yours, then?"
Eskel, Thank you!
Ciri, We have to open the gate for them!
Vesemir, Eskel's opened the gate! We can retreat beyond it!
Geralt, Fall back!
Geralt, You're not supposed to be out here!
Ciri, Too late now.
Eskel, They're coming in through the gaps!
Vesemir, Dimeritium bombs. You'll find more in the crates by the walls.
Geralt," We gotta close the portals! If we don't, we die!"
Eskel, Geralt! They're coming in through Savolla's breach!
Eskel, The wall stopped 'em!
Eskel, Damn the dogs! We should've patched up that wall!
Ermion," Geralt, hold them back! I must form a Circle of Vitality!"
Triss, Geralt! I can't hold them any longer! They're swarming the yard by the
Geralt, On my way!
Lambert, Bastard wants to break through! Get inside!
Vesemir, Come!
Ciri, Geralt... Where is he...? We must--
Eredin, You can't escape me this time!
Ciri, Aaaargh!
Eredin, Imlerith!
Vesemir, Run!
Eredin, She'll not abandon you. You humans are so...impractical.
Vesemir, Ciri! No!
Vesemir, Aargh! I forbid you! You always were an unruly child. I adored that
Vesemir, Now fly.
Ciri, Nooooooooooooooo!
h," Gvaed, gvaed uncym, cym'morth!"
Ciri, I...I was too late...to help him.
Geralt, It's not your fault.
Ciri, I should not have fled here to Kaer Morhen.
Yennefer," Avallac'h is weak, but alive. Triss is tending to the others."
Ciri, I nearly killed you... Killed everyone...
Geralt," I can't cry, don't know how..."
Geralt, We'd all be dead if not for you.
Ciri," No, Geralt. The Hunt would never have come to Kaer Morhen if I wasn't"
Geralt, Vesemir's funeral -- we should prepare.
Geralt, Don't blame yourself. No witcher's ever died in his own bed.
Ciri," You don't know how it is. To see someone you love die...because of you,"
Geralt, We all knew what we were signing up for.
Ciri," Yes, and you saved me. For how long? A week? A month?"
Geralt," We'll hide you, cover your tracks..."
Ciri, No. I will flee no more.
h," Va fail. For those who remain, death should never take precedence"
Geralt, I'll remember your teachings always. And the sacrifice you made.
Geralt, Thank you.
Ermion," Please. She was my ward, too. And the old should only ever stick around"
Geralt, I know.
Ermion," Whatever you aim to do now, remember you'll always find souls willing"
Geralt, Don't really know what I'll do next.
Ermion," When doubt plagues your mind, follow your instincts. Should they"
Geralt, Good advice.
Ermion," Bah! 'Course it is! I am a hierophant, aren't I? I must pick a"
Geralt," Thanks again, for everything."
Geralt," Thanks, I'll remember that."
Ermion," I shall take another look at the wounded, but I'll need to go soon."
Geralt," Go in health, Ermion."
Ermion, Till we meet again.
Hjalmar, There y'are. Cryin' shame about Vesemir. I'm sorry.
Geralt, Thanks for your help.
Hjalmar, I'd a debt to pay.
Geralt, Heading straight back to Skellige?
Hjalmar, Wouldn't be right to tarry -- war with the Black Ones won't wait.
Geralt, I know. Thanks.
Hjalmar," Duty calls. But listen, Geralt, you've a king for a mate. Rare's"
Geralt," Thanks, I'll remember that."
Geralt," So long, Hjalmar."
Geralt, What's on your mind?
Eskel, Kaer Morhen. Can't imagine this place without Vesemir. I'll head down to
Geralt, Come on. It's the only home we've ever had. Stay.
Eskel," No, Geralt. Place has been dying a while now. Last nail in the coffin"
Geralt, I get you.
Eskel, Try my luck in Lormark. There's always work where there's war. After
Geralt, Till next time.
Eskel," See you, Wolf."
Geralt, How are you feeling?
Lambert, Please.
Geralt, Thanks for everything.
Lambert, Sure.
Geralt, Get your health back.
Lambert, Leave me alone.
Geralt, What's eating you?
Lambert, Do you seriously not know? Get lost. I'm done with this idiotic
Geralt, Thanks for everything you did for me and Ciri.
Keira," May I be honest? Had I known what would happen here, I'd never have come"
Geralt, You going together?
Keira," I've an idea, but I need a witcher to help me see it through. Lambert"
Geralt, Hm. Good luck. And thanks again.
Keira, We're even now.
Geralt, Take care of yourselves. And thanks again for everything.
Geralt, So? Tell me.
Vernon, I can say I've seen it all now.
Ves, I still don't believe everything that happened.
Geralt, Thanks for coming. Thanks for risking your lives for me.
Ves, Take care of the girl. Don't let anyone harm her.
Geralt, Risked your lives for me. How can I repay you?
Vernon," We'll think of something, right?"
Ves, Definitely.
Geralt, What will you do?
Vernon," We're bound for Novigrad, to fight the next fight."
Ves," If you miss us, look for us at the camp."
Geralt, That was tough.
Letho, We managed.
Geralt, Thanks for helping.
Letho, You're welcome.
Geralt, Would you consider staying at Kaer Morhen?
Letho," It'd be nice. At least for a while, till I figure out what's next."
Geralt, Agreed. Do it.
Geralt, What will you do now?
Letho," Probably head east, cross the mountains. After that? We'll see."
Geralt, Farewell.
Zoltan," Come to see how I'm feelin'? Thanks, not bad."
Geralt, That's good.
Zoltan," Argh, son, horrible about Vesemir. I know you were close."
Geralt, Thanks. We were.
Zoltan," Listen, far be it from me to stick my beard where it'll scratch no"
Geralt," Not that simple, unfortunately. We have no way of finding them, they"
Geralt," There aren't enough of us. Sure, we repelled the Hunt's assault, but"
Zoltan," Forgive me, Geralt, but that's the blatherin' of a man who clearly"
Geralt," I'll do that, Zoltan."
h, Zireael can harness immense amounts of the Power. Why has no one
Yennefer," Actually, some did teach her."
h, Clearly to no effect.
Yennefer, I'll gladly argue you about this -- some other time.
Geralt, Haven't had a chance to talk. Thanks for your help. And for looking
h," You will thank me later. Now, we must take Zireael away from here,"
Triss," Anyone, everyone we could count on came here to Kaer Morhen."
Yennefer, Which is why we must seek the help of enemies. Magic is our best
Triss, You mean the Lodge?
Geralt, I don't want the Lodge anywhere near Ciri. Just don't trust those
Yennefer," What would you have us do instead? Fight alone, and die a beautiful"
Geralt," Don't trust the Lodge one bit, but doesn't seem like we have a"
Yennefer, Because we don't.
Geralt," Many of the Lodge's members are dead, the rest are in hiding."
Yennefer," Philippa Eilhart, Margarita Laux-Antille and Fringilla Vigo are"
Triss, And Francesca and Ida? Think they'd agree?
Yennefer, I think they'll take convincing. Would you rather speak to Keira
Triss, That would probably be best.
Yennefer," I've made an agreement with the emperor. In exchange for its help,"
Triss, Of course. Even got an idea where you could start.
Ciri, Dammit! Again you plan without even asking what I think! I've had enough
Geralt, You can't expose yourself.
Ciri, Am I a banner to be held aloft and kept from the enemy? That's how you
Geralt, You're right. Proved today you can take care of yourself.
h, Easier to pat someone on the back and hope things will work out
h, Zireael possesses a great power she cannot control. She is a danger
Ciri," First of all -- bollocks. Second -- if you're going to speak of courage,"
Geralt, Better go after her.
h," Wait, she needs time. We must let her resolve her grief on her"
Geralt, Ciri needs time.
h, True. But she also needs training.
h, She must learn to control her abilities.
Geralt, This training really necessary?
Yennefer, You saw what happened. She could be a greater threat than the Hunt.
Geralt, Fine. We'll stay here a while longer. Then join you and Triss in
Triss," Come on, Yen. The sooner we leave, the better."
Geralt, See you.
Ciri," Da-hah! It's not working, don't you see?!"
h, Discouraged after a mere eight attempts? Zireael...
Ciri, How many times must I try?
h, As many as it takes.
Ciri, But I'm not getting anywhere.
h, We shall return to this later.
Geralt," Didn't make it far first time out on the Gauntlet, either."
Ciri," Geralt, please. Not now. By comparison, the Gauntlet was a walk in the"
Geralt, What is?
Ciri, Avallac'h says nothing will come of this until I stop thinking about the
Geralt, What?
Ciri," Always manage to pull yourself together, focus, no matter what's"
Geralt," Hmm, don't know about vanilla pudding. Could work, but nothing picks"
Ciri, Suppose it can't kill me... Might as well try.
Geralt," Hmm, there's a certain ancient method. Vesemir taught it to me, and"
Ciri, Will you take me into the mountains and make me drink hemlock?
Geralt, The Skellige druids have used it for centuries. It always works...
Ciri, Heeeeeey! You'll regret that!
Ciri," Whew, that's strong."
Geralt, Maybe you oughta try a different method.
Ciri, We've tried at least twenty.
Geralt, Wouldn't let it worry you... Not like you need to excel at everything.
Ciri, Yeah... Pour me another.
Geralt, Hey! That's cheating!
Ciri, Wimp!
Geralt, We'll see about that!
Ciri, Haha! Come and get me!
Ciri, Hahaha!
Ciri, Ha-ha! Geralt of Rivia defeated! Need to work on those dodges.
Geralt, Sure I didn't let you win?
Ciri, Sure you're not smarting from a defeat by a true maestro? Heheh.
Ciri, You were right. That really works! Thanks.
Geralt, Glad to be of service. So what now?
Ciri, I'll go see where our dearest Sage is...
Ciri, Geralt! Geeeraaalt! Wake up!
Geralt, Wha...what? What's happening?
Ciri," Get up, we must go. I've saddled the horses."
Geralt," Ciri, it's the crack of dawn. Where do you wanna go?"
Ciri, To Velen. Bald Mountain. But a few days till the witches' sabbath. And
Geralt," Dunno, enlighten me."
Ciri, Imlerith. We'll have no better chance to get him.
Geralt," Don't know and don't really care, to tell you the truth. After this"
Ciri, Change of plans. Imlerith will be at the sabbath. We'll get him there.
Geralt, Where'd you get this idea? What's gotten into you?
Ciri, I must avenge Vesemir. The sabbath -- it's the perfect opportunity.
Geralt, Ciri... Sure you know what you're getting into?
Ciri, Yes. And I must do this.
Geralt, Why do I doubt Avallac'h's a fan of this idea?
Ciri," Do you see him here? I left him a letter, we'll rejoin him in Novigrad."
Geralt," How'd you learn all this? Imlerith, the sabbath..."
Ciri, Avallac'h. He told me of those who chase us. Claims knowledge itself
Ciri," Come, we shall talk on the way."
Geralt," Wait, something I gotta tell you before we go. You know the emperor"
Ciri, Yennefer...mentioned something.
Geralt, Wanted you to visit him.
Ciri, Why would you tell me now?
Geralt, Cause¹ this could be your last chance to see your...father.
Ciri, Think I should go?
Geralt, Probably just wants to talk.
Ciri, How can you be sure? What if he wants something more?
Geralt, Promised me he wouldn't force you to do anything.
Ciri, So I should go?
Geralt, He is your father...
Ciri, Vizima is on the way... I suppose we can drop in.
Geralt, Ahh. You don't look good in black.
Ciri, What do you mean?
Geralt," Think he wants to meet you because he missed you? As I see it, he's"
Ciri," Ugh. Might've expected it... Geralt, I'm fed up. I won't have others"
Geralt, Oughta decide for yourself.
Ciri, But I want your opinion -- should I go or not?
Geralt, Lead on.
Ciri, Ready?
Geralt, Let's go.
Mererid," Your Imperial Majesty, Geralt of Rivia and..."
Emhyr," Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, Queen of Cintra, Princess of Brugge and"
Emhyr, Get used to it. Before long every soul from Nilfgaard to the Dragon
Geralt, I always keep my word.
Emhyr, As do I.
Geralt, Ciri wanted to hear what you have to say.
Emhyr, And she will.
Emhyr, Your reward.
Geralt, Thanks.
Ciri, Geralt...
Chamberlain, Ten... Twenty... Thirty... Forty... Fifty... Sixty... Seventy...
Geralt, Didn't come to collect on a deal. You asked me to bring your daughter
Geralt, Ciri will hear you out. Then we leave.
Emhyr, Are you sure? Never again would you need to stalk monsters while wading
Geralt, I'm sure.
Emhyr," I understand. Honor prevents you from accepting coin. In that case, a"
Geralt, Thank you.
Emhyr, Now forgive me. I wish to speak to my daughter.
Mererid," Follow me, sir."
Morvran, White Wolf! Good to see you!
Geralt," Greetings, General."
Morvran," You had no trouble crossing the Pontar, I trust?"
Geralt, None.
Morvran, I take it you crossed via the ford at Ban Gleán. It's fortunate you
Geralt, Of course.
Morvran," While we're on the subject, how is our future ruler? Must admit I'm"
Geralt, You never know...
Geralt, Ciri hasn't agreed to that yet.
Morvran," Yes, of course, she's tactful, not one to celebrate an offer not yet"
Geralt, Indeed.
Geralt, Isn't it?
Morvran, Do you know any who would not like to be emperor of Nilfgaard?
Morvran, Can you imagine? I thought only the wine-addled minds of bards and
Ciri, Geralt! We're leaving!
Morvran," So nice to see you, my lady."
Ciri, Likewise. Time we were on our way.
Morvran, A shame you can't stay. I hope to continue this on another occasion.
Ciri, That makes one of us.
Geralt, Well?
Ciri," If he thinks he can buy me, he is sorely mistaken."
Geralt, He offer anything specific?
Ciri," Yes, very specific. And thoroughly absurd. Sorry. I don't want to talk"
Geralt, Won't pressure you. When you're ready. Let's go.
Ciri," By the way, that spectacle with the coin -- what was that?"
Geralt, Emperor's got lots. Couldn't see why he shouldn't share some with
Ciri, Is that what this was about -- from the start?
Geralt, No. It's always been about you. Only you.

Ciri, A true shame.
Geralt, Let's get this done.
Ciri," We must reach the peak, we'll find Imlerith there."
Geralt, We stand to find Imlerith here? You sure?
Ciri, Avallac'h told me of beings who commune with the Aen Elle elves. They

Geralt, You actually know this area?
Ciri, Centuries ago it was a hallowed site for druids. But then the Crones
Geralt, Seems to know it well.
Ciri, Avallac'h's a good tutor.
Ciri, The peasant folk of Velen call this night the Feast of Gifts. I've no
Geralt, Vanity?
Ciri," Any foe he faces, he strives to impress. The other one, Caranthir, is"
Guard, Should I shoot?
Man," Nay, the White One once served the Ladies."
Guard, But...he's an outsider!
Man, Let him approach.
Guard, But...
Man, They've come for the feast. Wouldn't do to cast them out.
Geralt, Didn't come to celebrate. We need to get to the top of the mountain.
Man," The gate is shut -- you'll not pass. But we've fires down thataway, with"
Geralt," We thank you for the invitation. Be glad to sit down, right?"
Ciri, Speak for yourself.
Man, Come with me.
Geralt," We won't join you at your fires, though we thank you for the"
Man," You wish to see the Ladies. I, too, hope to, afore I die. Go up the"
Geralt, Do just that. Farewell.
Geralt, We should be going.
Man, Eager to see the Ladies. I share your yearnin'.
Ciri," We're afire with yearning. Come, Geralt, we must get there before"
Man, Go to the tent and stand before Thecla. She's the one who decides who's
Geralt, This celebration -- what's it about?
Guard," Why d'ye need to know, wanderer?"
Man," No need for anger. The White One served the Ladies, as we do now. We"
Ciri," I met one of your gifts to the Crones -- sniveling, scared to death,"
Geralt, Stay calm.
Geralt, Your children -- why do the Ladies need them?
Man, We know not and never ask.
Ciri, You don't know? Then let me tell you.
Man," Tell us instead what a peasant, his own young 'uns starvin', is to do"
Geralt, Said the Ladies bestow blessings on you...
Man," Aye, for our lives turn thus -- first a summer of laborin' 'neath the"
Geralt, What do you do with the acorns?
Man," The Velen elders gather, hold council. Some favor grindin' 'em to"
Ciri, A handful of enchanted acorns is enough for all Velen?
Man, Tis¹ never enough.
Geralt, Heard enough about this. We've got other questions.
Geralt, Mentioned a gate. Said we wouldn't pass.
Man, Only the Chosen visit the Ladies. Every year young lads and lasses climb
Geralt, Let me guess -- the young lads and lasses don't return.
Man," No, they return, happy and radiant. But rare is the one who then stays"
Geralt, Ladies of the Wood visit you?
Man," If they favor us. My father told me they descended once, passed from"
Geralt," Haven't done it in a long time, then."
Ciri, No point waiting to see if we'll get lucky.
Geralt," Yeah, we gotta try to reach the peak."
Ciri, Look -- a child.
Geralt, No -- a godling. I know him. Name's Johnny.
Ciri, Look over there -- children.
Geralt, Both godlings. Ran into them before.
Geralt, They say ghosts are manifestations of inner fears. Hauntings are said
Johnny," Well I'll be, you're back! And I see you've found your lass! I'm"
Ciri, They call me Ciri. Nice to meet you.
Geralt," How're things, Johnny?"
Johnny," Health's good, so no complaints. What brings you here?"
Johnny, He the one who kicked you out of your house?
Sarah, Yes.
Johnny," Well, I must have a word with 'im."
Sarah, Don't hurt 'im!
Johnny, Who do you think you are? Kickin' Sarah outta her home! How could
Geralt," Wasn't her home, and besides--"
Sarah," Please, it worked out in the end. If I'd not left Novigrad, I'd never"
Johnny," Fine, I'll let you off this time. See you found your lass. So what"
Geralt, We gotta climb the mountain. Can you help?
Johnny," I'd rather try to dissuade you, but I'm certain that would be in"
Ciri, Even more so.
Johnny," Figured as much. Sigh¹. Path to the peak starts here, past the gate."
Geralt, We're heading up the mountain. Any advice?
Sarah, Yeah -- don't do it. Johnny says the Crones aren't to be fooled with.
Johnny," You've barely found your lass. Didn't find her just to lose her now,"
Ciri, We'll be fine.
Johnny," Do as you will. Path up the mountain starts t'other side of the gate,"
Geralt, Gotta get to the summit. Simple as that.
Johnny," It's Thecla you'll need to convince. She's blind as your bum, but"
Ciri, We shan't try to trick her.
Johnny, She sits in that tent over yonder. I wish you luck and do hope we
Geralt, Thanks for the advice. We should go.
Sarah, Good luck.
Johnny, Visit us sometime. We've a place not far from here.
Ciri, We'll be certain to stop by. So long.
Geralt, The key -- why do you doubt we can get it?
Johnny," Good grief, you're worse than children! Three souls are allowed atop"
Ciri, I believe I qualify.
Johnny, But he's old and ugly. What good is he?
Geralt, Pretty damn good at finding lost voices.
Johnny, Then go find the voice of reason. It'll tell you to turn back.
Geralt, Gate's locked? Why?
Johnny," Good grief, worse than children, these two. Durin' each Sabbath the"
Sarah, She's young and beautiful.
Johnny, But he's sure not.
Geralt, Let us worry about Thecla.
Johnny," Don't lie to her, she'll sniff it out at once. If she refuses to"
Ciri, The trial?
Johnny," Uh, Thecla will explain."
Geralt, We're here to find an elf named Imlerith. Ciri thinks he might be a
Johnny," Big bloke, in full plate? Goin' the right way -- he's atop the"
Ciri, You've seen him?
Johnny, Saw him in the bog first. Water froze beneath his horse's hooves.
Ciri, He killed my friend.
Johnny," Wouldn't seek revenge, if I were you. Even the Ladies bow and scrape"
Geralt, We're looking for an elf named Imlerith. Ciri thinks the Crones
Sarah, The big knight? He near trampled me!
Ciri, On his way up the mountain?
Johnny, Yeah. What's it you want from him?
Ciri, He killed my friend.
Johnny," Out for vengeance, eh? Let it go. Dyin' foolishly won't help. Even"
Geralt," What are you doing here? Last we met, you and the Crones weren't"
Johnny, I got an invitation I couldn't refuse -- same as every year. In their
Geralt, What're you doing here? And how'd you two end up together?
Johnny, Got an invitation we couldn't refuse. Around the Sabbath the Ladies
Ciri, Did I hear right? You walked here all the way from Novigrad?
Sarah, Weren't no trouble for someone who talks to birds. A blackbird told
Thecla," Hm... Who's that? Well, c'mon, come closer, girl! Aye. What's she like?"
Marica," Narrow hips, sparkly eyes -- a strikin', feisty lass."
Thecla," Never had a man? Mff. Never mind, got me answer. I choose you, girl."
Geralt," If she goes up the mountain, I go with her."
Geralt, Ciri?
Ciri, Wonderful. Who wouldn't want to meet the Ladies? My companion comes
Thecla, Hmhm. What else has the cat dragged in?
Marica, It's gray and veiny. Got a scar. And eyes like a viper.
Thecla," Aye, mff... Stinks of clotted blood and corpses. Plus it's old and"
Geralt, I'm going with her.
Thecla," Heheheh, he's fire in his gut. What do ye see?"
Marica," He's determined. He loves the girl, but he seeks to hide it from us."
Geralt, You misjudged me. I'm worthy as anyone.
Thecla, Mmm... Girl?
Ciri, He's sprier than any youth. Only smells like corpses because he kills
Geralt, What's this about? What've you chosen her for?
Thecla, Tell 'im.
Woman, Each year three Chosen have the honor to meet the Ladies.
Geralt, What happens after they've had this honor?
Woman," When they return, they speak o' the past no more. Joy rules them and"
Thecla, Perhaps I was mistaken. Perhaps there's life in 'im yet? By ancient
Geralt, I accept the challenge.
Thecla, Heheheh. Come.
Geralt, What kind of challenge?
Thecla, Tell 'im.
Marica, You must descend into the cave and bathe in the waters below the
Ciri, What's the catch?
Thecla," The waters're deep, the waters're murky."
Thecla," Look this over -- a coin from days of yore. Falka burns on its reverse,"
Thecla, Now bring me the coin.
Ciri," I was beginning to worry. Come, let's get the key."
Marica, They're back.
Thecla, Whaddaya want?
Geralt, Got that coin you tossed in the lake.
Thecla, It reeks of sludge.
Geralt," Nothing I can do about that. So, gonna keep your word?"
Thecla," I always do, my boy. Show the coin to the gatekeeper past the"
Geralt, Can't help but be curious -- what's at the summit?
Thecla, Tell 'im.
Marica, The Ladies dwell there. But only the Chosen may look upon them.
Geralt," I know that, I want--"
Marica, You'll learn nothin' else here.
Geralt, Farewell.
Ciri, That went smoothly.
Geralt, Weren't the one to do the diving in the cave.
Ciri," Stop whining. You're a witcher, you've dived in murkier waters."
Geralt, Yeah. Have to tell you about the time I hunted a zeugl.
Thecla," The last of the Chosen will now ascend the mount to the peak, to meet"
Fugas," Hm... What's your name, girl?"
Ciri, What's yours?
Fugas, Hmm... Your name doesn't matter. Atop the peak you'll lose it and get
Geralt, Got something to do up there. So just let us through.
Fugas," Hahaha! Heh, givin' me orders? You? A human?"
Geralt, I passed the trial. Here's proof. Recognize it?
Fugas, The Defier's Oren. A death sentence.
Geralt, One tough son of a bitch.
Ciri," We've no time to lose. I'll tend to Imlerith, you take the Crones."
Geralt, No chance. I'm going after Imlerith.
Ciri," Fine, let's play for it -- rock, paper, scissors."
Ciri, Dammit! Two out of three.
Geralt," Out of the question. I'll climb the mountain, you face the Crones."
Ciri, Hardly a challenge.
Geralt, They're extremely dangerous. Be careful.
Ciri, You too.
Geralt, Imlerith's a bigger threat than the Crones. I should face him.
Ciri, I'm no worse a fighter than you.
Geralt, We both know that's not true. Listen to me this once.
Ciri, But--
Geralt, No buts.
Ciri, Fine. Be careful.
Geralt, You too.
Ciri, I must get down there.
Brewess, How was he?
Weavess," He lived a life of love, and knew no bitterness."
Whispess, Yum-yum.
Whispess," Welcome, Child of the Elder Blood."
Weavess, We knew you would return.
Brewess, Your taste lingers on our tongues.
Ciri, You've talked enough.
Ciri, Argh! Come here!
Ciri, Dammit.
Geralt," Imlerith's at the summit, gotta be."
Imlerith, The sisters said you would come. They saw you arrive in the water's
Geralt, I'm here alone.
Imlerith," A lie which will change nothing. First you, then her."
Geralt, Yeah. We're both here.
Imlerith, Where is the girl?
Geralt, Doesn't matter. You'll never get her.
Imlerith," You fought bravely in the ruined keep, to the bitter end. I trust"
Imlerith, Raargh!
Imlerith, Who taught you to fight like this?
Geralt, The witcher you slew.
Imlerith, Ugh...
Ciri, We did it.
Geralt, Barely. How'd it go down there?
Ciri, I slew only two of the Crones. The third fled...with Vesemir's medallion.
Geralt, Coming here? Good idea.
Ciri, I knew we'd succeed. From the start.
Geralt, You avenged Vesemir.
Ciri, Avallac'h claims vengeance is only ever satisfying when served cold.
Geralt, We got lucky this time. Hope it stays with us.
Ciri," It's not luck. You're a professional killer, and I'm a chip off the"
Ciri, Now to find Eredin and kill him. An oren for your thoughts?
Geralt, Wondering what to tell Yennefer when we get to Novigrad.
Ciri, Tell her the truth. Always. I wonder if Triss and Yennefer have found the
Geralt," Yeah, let's get going."
Ciri, Thank you -- for coming with me.
Geralt, C'mere.
Ciri," Heh, let's go."
Geralt," Gimme a minute. I'm old, need more rest."
Ciri, Hm. You are and you do. Let's stay a bit longer.
Stregomir, The oak is dead!
Ciri," The oak, the Crones. I fear that was your last feast."
Man, What of our acorns?
Geralt, I've got one. Take it.
Guard, But one? What'll we do now?
Geralt, Your acorns? No idea. Path to the summit's clear -- you can always
Ciri, Or just go home.
Geralt," Don't know, don't care."
Ciri, You must learn to live without them.
Geralt, There won't be any more acorns. Need to get by without them.
Guard, What now?
Geralt," This is no longer no man's land, it's no longer the Ladies' land. It's"
Stregomir, But...what're we to do?
Ciri," Come, Geralt. It's time."
Geralt, Manage...on your own.
Ciri, They're...nonhumans. Thought it was mages the hunters and the Temple
Geralt, Mages left...hunters needed a new quarry.
Ciri, It's changed a bit since I last left.
Geralt, Radovid's growing bolder.
Ciri, They say whoever takes Novigrad will take the north.
Geralt," A free city, full of riches -- tempting prize."
Zoltan, Dandeeelion! Ready some tankards! We've guests.
Dandelion, Geralt! Ciri! When I learned Geralt had found you--
Ciri," Glad to see you in one piece, too, Dandelion."
Zoltan, Where've you two been?
Geralt, Just finished hunting down the Crones of Velen and a general of the
Zoltan," Well, you've had a busy morn, then, haven't you..."
Geralt," Went to Kaer Morhen first, then Velen..."
Dandelion," Leave 'em alone, Zoltan. Can't you see they're beat?"
Dandelion," In fact, you look terrible! Like you could really use some rest!"
Ciri, Gladly take some. Point me to a room.
Zoltan," Course. Come on, little swallow, I'll take ye."
Ciri," Let's meet later, Geralt. I've a little matter to resolve. I'll freshen"
Geralt, Right.
Geralt, Anyone here besides us?
Geralt, Anything happen while we were away?
Dandelion," Uh, Pretty Polly came down with a fever, Matt Oyster caught a"
Geralt, Dandelion...
Geralt, Lodge of Sorceresses -- Triss and Yen were supposed to gather the
Dandelion," They're working on it. Triss is upstairs, waiting for you."
Geralt, Yen? At that portside dive? Why?
Dandelion," Didn't inform me. Imagine that. Ah, and that elf of yours moved into"
Geralt, Gave him your best room?
Dandelion," He didn't exactly ask. I'd prepared another room for him, but he"
Geralt, Thanks. Looks like I'll have my hands full...
Geralt," Greetings, Triss."
Triss, Have you lost your mind?! You went after Imlerith by yourselves?! To
Geralt," Come on, we came out of it fine. Can't say the same for Imlerith."
Triss, That's the sole comfort I find in this. But it's no justification.
Geralt, But it didn't. I was there.
Geralt, Yeah. But I'd never let Ciri come to any harm. You know that.
Geralt, Shouldn't have... I'm sorry.
Triss," It ended well, luckily. But it didn't have to."
Geralt, I know. But Imlerith's gone. That's what matters.
Geralt, Ciri had to do it. I couldn't let her go alone. You'd have done the
Geralt, Had the situation under control. Mind if we change the subject?
Geralt, Any success with the Lodge? Anyone out there willing to help?
Triss," It doesn't look good... Ida outright refused, while Francesca won't"
Geralt, Town's decked in Radovid's colors. And we passed a sizable force of
Triss, Novigrad's a lost cause. Unless by some miracle the emperor takes the
Geralt," Hm, never thought of mages as fond of Emhyr."
Triss, Better predictable Emhyr and his semblance of freedom than crazy
Geralt, Passed burning pyres on the way into town. Nonhumans on them.
Triss," Things grow worse by the day. No mages left in the city, so the"
Geralt, And the others? Keira? Margarita? Philippa?
Geralt, You can count Keira out...
Triss, I sincerely hope we can contact Philippa and Rita in time.
Geralt, Yen and I rescued Margarita.
Triss," I know. Dandelion set her up in a room upstairs. She's resting,"
Triss, Keira? I thought you of all people'd know... I sincerely hope we can
Triss, Keira was seen in Velen at one point. No word of her since. She could
Triss, Keira...thought too much of her charm. Tried to buy her way into
Geralt," Keira Metz was manipulative, a schemer -- and loved every minute of it."
Geralt, Few can refuse a sorceress. And Keira Metz certainly had her ways...
Geralt," Just his style... Coulda had her hanged, decapitated -- even a"
Geralt, Keira played with fire. Had to know she might get burned.
Triss," Singed hands, maybe...but impaled?"
Geralt, Don't blame yourself. Keira wasn't one to listen to reason.
Triss," Before we leave, we have to bury her. I won't let crows pick her rotting"
Geralt, Guards'll hand over the body given the proper incentive.
Triss, I really hope we contact Rita and Philippa -- before they meet a similar
Geralt, I've seen worse matches... Hope things work out for them.
Triss," I hope things work out for us, and we find Philippa and Rita."
Geralt, We will. We have to.
Triss," I'll rest easier when they're both here, with us."
Geralt, Know where they are?
Triss, Yennefer's looking into Rita's whereabouts. I have to figure out where
Geralt," So, learn anything?"
Triss, A few things that could be interesting. Prefer the long version or
Geralt, Guess.
Triss," In short, she was here, at this inn, under our noses the whole time."
Geralt, Zoltan's owl?
Triss, Mhm.
Geralt, So why isn't she here anymore?
Triss, Because Zoltan lost her in a card game a few days ago.
Geralt, Tell me everything. I want the details.
Triss, After fleeing Loc Muinne Philippa ended up here in Novigrad. She
Geralt, De Vleester? Rings a bell...
Geralt," Philippa and a former lover? Something tells me ""happily ever"
Triss, Philippa'd made a fool of him once. Arthur was out for revenge. He
Geralt," Zoltan. Huh. So Philippa was here, under our noses, the whole time?"
Triss," ""Was"" -- precisely. Zoltan lost her in a card game a few days ago."
Geralt, Know what Yen's found out?
Triss," You'll need to ask her, I've been busy trying to find Philippa."
Geralt," Kidding, right?"
Triss," Sadly, no."
Geralt, Yup. That's Zoltan for you...
Triss," A man showed up here, fleeced Zoltan bare, then proposed they play for"
Geralt, Who was it? Know where he lives?
Triss, He's not from here. No one knows him.
Geralt, Great. We got any leads?
Triss, We have this.
Geralt, That Philippa the owl's feather? Thinking divination?
Triss," Specifically, hydromancy and a form of sortilege. We need a fountain"
Geralt, One outside the Passiflora could work...
Triss, Good idea. Let's go.
Geralt, Need to take care of something first. Meet you somewhere later?
Triss," Fine. The fountain outside the Passiflora. And...hurry, please."
Geralt, Don't you think we oughta get Keira first?
Triss, Hmm... Right... Meet you on the main square at midnight.
Geralt," Couldn't help it. Grew curious about this ""little matter"" you have"
Geralt, Looking for something in particular?
Ciri, Hmm. A pretty little trinket...
Geralt, Wanna give someone a present?
Ciri, One of the people I told you about... A gesture of gratitude.
Ciri, When I was last in Novigrad I had my share of troubles...
Geralt, So I heard.
Ciri," A few people helped me then, others...not so much. Now I mean to repay"
Geralt, Lead the way.
Ciri, We'll start with the Bits.
Geralt, Who're we gonna visit?
Ciri, You'll see...
Ciri, We need to go to Temple Isle.
Geralt, Don't remember you being religious...
Ciri, Nor am I now. Let's go.
Geralt," Love to accompany you, but I gotta do something first."
Ciri, No problem. I'll wait here.
Ciri," In that case, I'll await you there -- the market in Gildorf."
Ciri, Geralt!
Geralt, What is it?
Ciri," Nothing yet, but something's afoot. Philippa and Margarita with to speak"
Geralt, They say about what?
Ciri," No, but I have my suspicions."
Geralt, Then talk to them. Not like they're out to bite you.
Ciri," If they do, I'll bite back."
Geralt, So what's the problem?
Geralt," Don't waste any time, do they.¹ I don't like this."
Ciri, Neither do I.
Ciri, I bet they have plans for me. And they're deigning to inform me of them.
Geralt, Not a conversation you're likely to avoid. I'll go with you if you
Ciri, Hmm... They'll weigh their words more carefully with you there.
Geralt, Wouldn't be so sure... But two heads're better than one. Let's get
Geralt," Got nothing to be afraid of. Just go, listen to what they have to"
Ciri, And if they try to force me into something?
Geralt, Can't believe you'd ever let them. Margarita's only ever cared about
Ciri," Thanks, Geralt."
Geralt," Well, go. Don't give 'em any more time to strategize."
Ciri, You wished to speak.
Philippa, To you. Not to Geralt.
Ciri, Geralt stays or we both leave.
Rita," Let him stay, Phil. He'd learn all of it anyways, eventually."
Philippa, Ekhem. Fine then. So long as he does not interrupt.
Geralt, Think of me as part of the decor.
Geralt, I won't. Until Ciri decides otherwise.
Philippa," The Lodge once had great plans for you, important plans. Surely you"
Ciri, As before? I'm to marry some princeling and become your puppet?
Rita," You were a child then, and we...misjudged the situation. This time we"
Geralt, No equality in the Lodge. That's garbage. Some have always taken the
Rita," A wise and capable sorceress finds the role, the position that best"
Philippa," And yours should be supreme, you deserve to lead."
Geralt, The Lodge of Sorceresses has been outlawed throughout the Continent.
Philippa," Kings die, realms fall, but magic endures."
Philippa," Realize, please, that you were made for great things. Work with us"
Ciri, I have Avallac'h for that...
Philippa, You allow this? Do you truly believe his intentions are pure?
Geralt," I don't, but I'd rather deal with one Sage than the entire Lodge."
Geralt," Purer than yours, that's certain."
Geralt," I don't trust him, I don't trust you, but that doesn't matter. Ciri"
Rita, Sages invariably have hidden agendas. Altruism is simply not part of
Philippa," We will assure you knowledge and protection, but you shall be your"
Rita," We don't expect you to commit now. Think it over, what you've heard, what"
Ciri," If that is all, then..."
Geralt," ...We need to go to Skellige, find the Sunstone. Avallac'h awaits"
Yennefer, So?
Ciri, I don't know... Don't really want to talk about it... I'm going for a
Geralt, I could use a little rest myself...
Yennefer, Good idea. Get some sleep.
Yennefer, Not going with her?
Geralt, Can't hold her hand if they're gonna take her seriously.
Yennefer, True. Good decision.
Geralt," Relax, she'll be fine."
Yennefer," Rita won't hurt her, but Philippa... She can be ruthless."
Geralt, Calm down. You'll wear a hole in the floor.
Yennefer, I'll calm down once she comes out.
Geralt, Ciri's been in tougher situations and come out of them all right.
Yennefer," True, we managed to instill some principles, skills that have"
Geralt," Exactly, so there's nothing to be afraid of."
Yennefer, Of course. I'll just have a peek.
Geralt, Don't spy on her. You really have that little faith?
Yennefer, I don't trust Philippa and Rita.
Geralt, So why'd you even allow this meeting to happen?
Yennefer," For the same reason you did: if they're to respect her, she can't"
Geralt, Knew you couldn't resist...
Yennefer," Pots and kettles, Geralt. You were dying to do the same, I saw you."
Geralt, You're the one with your face to the door.
Yennefer," Mmm, which is why I can see what's happening."
Geralt," Finally. Thought you wouldn't do it, didn't have the gall."
Geralt, Lemme have a look.
Yennefer, In your dreams.
Geralt, What do you see?
Yennefer, Philippa pontificating. Ciri pacing wall to wall. She's stopped.
Geralt, What now?
Geralt, That's my Ciri. Probably gave her an earful.
Yennefer, Quiet! Hear she comes.
Yennefer, So?
Ciri, You were eavesdropping.
Geralt, Yes.
Yennefer, No.
Ciri, You haven't changed a bit.
Geralt, Tell us what you talked about?
Ciri," I'd rather not. Not yet, at least."
Yennefer," Of course, when you're ready."
Geralt," Take a walk, get some air... We need to sail to Skellige. Avallac'h's"
Ciri, Of course. I'll be there soon.
Geralt, Just wanted to...
Yennefer," Go meet Avallac'h. He wished to see you, apparently."
Geralt," If you wanna be alone for a while, to digest, process..."
Ciri, Yes. I shall go for a walk. I must unwind.
Geralt," Remember, we need to go to Skellige. Avallac'h awaits at the port."
Ciri, I remember. I'll be there soon.
Geralt, I hope she's...
Yennefer, She'll be fine. She's tougher than we think. You ought to visit
QUEST, FINAL PREPARATIONS |_
Triss, We're here.
Geralt, Nice and quiet. Shouldn't be any disturbances.
Triss, Sure you weren't followed?
Geralt, Yeah.
Triss, Let's begin. Observe the water's surface carefully. We can't let
Triss, Graeme et dwyr! Rhobeir'me gelle a failte!
Geralt, What's that?
Triss, Uhh...nothing. A preliminary image.
Geralt, Looks familiar... A bathhouse. I know the place. Dijkstra! He has her.
Triss, That was the recent past. Anything might happen to her in Dijkstra's
Geralt, Not so fast. The first image... What was that?
Triss," Nothing, really."
Geralt, Don't brush me off. I know how hydromancy works. Image appeared because
Triss," It was... Kind Tancred asked me to be his court advisor, in Kovir."
Geralt," You mentioned Kovir in the lighthouse. I understand why, now... Did"
Triss, Only a fool would refuse. Tancred's been supportive of the mages from

Triss, You don't exactly sound thrilled...

Triss," I wasn't sure at first... Ultimately, though, it's something I've"
Geralt, You deserve it. Best decision Tancred ever made.
Triss, Thank you. I hope I can rise to the task.
Geralt," You will. With you leading it, the Council might actually do some"
Geralt," You mentioned Kovir in the lighthouse. I understand why, now... Huh."
Triss, I didn't... I said yes.
Geralt," Triss... These last few months, they've really taught you nothing?"
Triss, Tancred's been supportive of the mages from the start. The evacuation
Geralt," You mentioned Kovir in the lighthouse. I understand why, now..."
Triss, Only a fool would refuse. Tancred's been supportive of the mages from
Geralt," You mentioned Kovir in the lighthouse. I understand why, now..."
Geralt," The vision was of a house, not a royal court..."
Triss, It's the house that awaits us in Pont Vanis.
Triss," When we're done here, when all this is over, once we've defeated the"
Geralt, Guess you've got everything planned out...
Triss, You don't like it?
Geralt, I like it. A lot.
Geralt, I'm...surprised... Don't really know what to say...
Triss, You don't need to decide right away. But I'm glad you know. I was
Geralt, Triss?
Triss, Yes?
Geralt, We'll be together. And you don't need to turn anything down.
Geralt," I dunno, Triss... The life of a witcher, it's no fairytale. But I"
Triss, I'm not asking you to sacrifice anything. You're not cut out to be a
Geralt, Always used to be Kaer Morhen... House in your vision looks a lot
Triss, Ha... I'll tell you the details later. Right now we need to get
Geralt, Right.
Triss, Come on.
Geralt," Let's go to the bathhouse, might not be too late."
Triss, Come on.
Geralt, Was that the past or the future?
Triss, The recent past. We have to hurry.
Triss, I hope we get there in time. I hope Dijkstra hasn't already hurt her.
Geralt, The possibilities are many. Could be Dijkstra that got hurt.
Triss, Not likely. Dijkstra never forgave her for sending assassins after him.
Geralt," Weakened, maybe, but still a powerful sorceress. If Dijkstra's men take"
Geralt, Guess they underestimated Philippa...
Triss, You were right. She must've changed back into human form. Quick! I sense
Reuven," Surrender! This place is a maze, witch! You'll never get out! Goddamn"
Geralt, We'll handle this.
Reuven," Oh, no! No, no! The sorceress stays here."
Geralt," Stay here, Triss. In case she tries to flee this way."
Triss," Be careful. She might be blind, but she's still dangerous. And don't"
Geralt, We're going together.
Reuven, Not a chance.
Triss," It's fine, Geralt. I'll stay. In case she tries to flee this way."
Geralt, Fine. Be right back.
Henchman, Wha... What's happenin'?
Henchman, W-w-witcher. He's gotta die.
Henchman, Kill the witcher.
Geralt," Damn, she cast a spell on them."
Geralt, Philippa! Wait!
Bart, Perty birdy... Good stink...
Philippa," I am your master now. You're to protect me, understood?"
Bart, Bart standunder.
Philippa, Stand here -- and let no one pass!
Bart, Bart herestand. None pastgo.
Bart, Witcher no pastgo. Perty birdy nosay.
Geralt," Dammit, cast a spell on him too."
Geralt, I need her. Gotta catch her.
Bart, Birdy no want you her catch.
Geralt, Get out of my way before things get unpleasant.
Bart, Bart no can do. Bart promise.
Geralt, You asked for it.
Geralt," She's hurt, did you see that? I wanna help her."
Bart, Birdy no pastgo say. Bart no let pastgo.
Geralt, Hmm... Ever had a stomachache?
Bart," Hmm... Ache, aye. Bart once old drowner eat."
Geralt, Her stomach aches like she just ate a hundred old drowners.
Bart, Bart no want... Drowner make ache very bad...
Geralt, Let me pass. I can help her.
Bart, Hmm... Bart let pastgo... Witchar¹ help.
Geralt, I wanna help you!
Philippa, Help me die?! Don't hold your breath!
Geralt, I'm not out to hurt you!
Philippa, Bollocks!
Philippa, You will not take me!
Geralt, I wanna help you!
Philippa," Hah! Forgive me, but I just don't believe you!"
Geralt, Gotta be kidding me...
Philippa," What's happened? So quiet, all of a sudden?"
Geralt," Stop squirming. If I wanted to kill you, you'd be long dead by now."
Philippa, What do you want? To torment me? To watch others do so?
Geralt, I need your help.
Philippa, Betray me and I will--
Geralt," Relax. Not planning on it. Triss is outside, she'll explain everything."
Reuven," Deepest apologies, but the lady will come with me."
Geralt," Dijkstra...I don't have time for this, get out of my way."
Reuven," I've no quarrel with you, Geralt. But Phil and I have lots to talk"
Geralt, Not gonna demonstrate a damn thing. I need her.
Reuven," And I don't give a flying fuck. I've awaited this moment forever, so,"
Geralt," I like you, Dijkstra. Don't make me hurt you."
Reuven, Save your threats for the rats that run about the port. They don't
Geralt," I remember your little...bond, but this is no time for a lovers'"
Reuven, But it's an excellent time to settle a score.
Reuven, Philippa will come with me. And answer for all the courtesies she's
Geralt," Always knew the value of information, Dijkstra..."
Reuven, Which is why I don't believe you have anything I don't already know.
Geralt, The emperor of Nilfgaard wasn't able to sway the Trade Corporation.
Reuven," Opposition nibbling at his arse, eh? Hm, seems the White Flame won't"
Geralt," His daughter has returned. The emperor wants to abdicate, give her"
Reuven, Cirilla? Impossible! This...this could shift the tide of war...
Reuven, But what's Philippa got to do with it?
Geralt, Philippa will help us protect Ciri from the Wild Hunt.
Reuven, Go. Before I change my mind.
Geralt," Emperor himself told me, so...information's first hand."
Reuven, Emhyr's a lying whore.
Geralt, When it comes to his daughter's future? Doubt it.
Geralt, Time'll tell if I am or not.
Reuven," Except if you are talking bollocks, and I swallow it whole,"
Geralt, Guess you gotta take that risk.
Reuven, You've no idea the importance of this information. A change on the
Geralt, You didn't actually believe you could do it? Radovid's crazy but
Reuven, Silence.
Philippa," Do I understand you correctly? You want to kill Radovid? Well,"
Reuven," You know too much, Phil. Yet one more reason why you must die."
Geralt, Think you might wanna hear her out? Daresay Philippa despises
Philippa, I'm content someone apart from myself has finally gotten the
Reuven, Save your praise for others. I couldn't give a shit.
Philippa," Currently, only two individuals stand to draw Radovid off of"
Geralt, You'd agree to be the bait?
Philippa, I fear you'd be hard pressed to convince Emhyr to dangle
Reuven," Fat fucking chance! Geralt, I wouldn't trust this cunt to hard"
Philippa, Rightly so -- I'm terrible with eggs. But think on this:
Reuven," Out of the question! Geralt, get her out of here before I burst"
Geralt," Dijkstra, Philippa's not gonna die -- we're done discussing that."
Reuven," Situation's changed, witcher. She's in a position now to foil my"
Philippa, Do you really think I will run to warn the man who gouged my
Geralt, Sorry. Can't let that happen.
Reuven," Ooh! Aaa-aaa-aargh! No, no -- not my leg! Arrrrggggghhhhhh!"
Triss," Sorry to take so long, but I had to deal with the guards."
Philippa," Hello, Triss."
Triss," Philippa, are you all right?"
Philippa, I've been better.
Triss, I'll get you out of here. 
Geralt, Gonna be all right?
Triss," Yeah, thanks for your help."
Triss, Meet me at night in the main square. We have to take care of Keira.
Geralt, See you then.
QUEST, FINAL PREPARATIONS |_
Geralt, Buy you a drink?
Yennefer, I'm afraid the dishwater's as good as it gets in this establishment.
Geralt, Mine.
Yennefer, Lying didn't always come to easily to you.
Geralt, If you intend to--
Yennefer, I was about to say...it's nice that you protect her. And you did
Geralt, Ciri's.
Yennefer, As I thought. I'm glad you went with her.
Geralt, Spare me your lecture about responsibility.
Yennefer," I was actually going to recite an anthem praising your glory, but"
Geralt, I thought you'd be angry.
Yennefer, Angry? Why? Because you supported Ciri in her decision? Or because
Geralt, What if we'd lost?
Yennefer, We wouldn't be having this conversation. And the female part of the
Geralt, Hm. Charming place. Why're you here?
Yennefer," You'll find out soon. In the meantime, tell me about Philippa."
Geralt, Nothing to tell yet. Came to get you first.
Geralt, Triss and I found her and freed her. It turned out Dijkstra had
Yennefer, That's a relief.
Geralt," So, gonna tell me why you're here?"
Yennefer, I was able to establish Margarita's whereabouts -- the prison in
Geralt, What do you know about this fugitive?
Yennefer, I know he's the only one ever to escape from Deireadh. Every
Geralt, Sure he can be trusted?
Yennefer, We'll soon find out. He just walked in.
Geralt, Talked to Triss. Reconvening the Lodge -- it's not going so well...
Yennefer," Dangerous times, especially for sorceresses. Each thinks five times"
Yennefer, Abbé Faria?
Faria, Who's asking?
Geralt, We'd like to talk.
Faria, Damn...
Yennefer, Ugh. Best run and get him.
Geralt," Dammit, scaled the ladder. Guess I'm in for a roof walk..."
Yennefer," Take off the kid gloves, Geralt."
Faria, Help!
Yennefer," Stop screaming, or I'll harm you."
Geralt, Thought you'd agreed to meet.
Yennefer," I said I'd found him, not that I'd spoken to him."
Faria, What do you want from me?! Let me be!
Geralt, Calm down. We just want to chat.
Faria," Uh-huh, and then stick a shiv between my ribs, leave me in the gutter."
Yennefer, Look at us. Do we look like bandits to you?
Faria," Hm... No... Not really, no¹."
Yennefer," I'm glad you agree. Besides, you'd be worthless to us dead."
Faria, So...you shan't hurt me?
Geralt," No. You're gonna tell us your story, then be on your way."
Faria," Hm...so be it. But we really ought to go back to Kate's. It's, uh,"
Yennefer," Drink up, it'll help."
Faria, Thanks... What do you want?
Yennefer, To get into Deireadh.
Faria," Find a hunter, tell him you practice magic. They'll lock you up"
Geralt," We need to get in without anyone noticing. Tell us how you escaped,"
Geralt, They say no one gets outta Deireadh alive...
Faria," Aye, so they say... My thought -- why not try it dead?"
Yennefer, But they burn the corpses.
Faria, They didn't start burning them until they learned an old fellow like
Geralt, So theoretically we could get in the same way you got out.
Yennefer, Assuming we don't mind the company of decomposing corpses.
Faria, And assuming you can squeeze through the grate. They barred the
Geralt, Huh. Explosives could take care of that.
Yennefer, For half the city to hear us? I've a better plan. Oxenfurt was
Geralt, Which have to connect to the sewers somewhere. If we can find a way
Yennefer, We'll get into the prison.
Geralt, So you played dead... No one caught on?
Faria, As a youth I'd apprenticed with an apothecary in Silverton. Learned
Yennefer, You might have lost your life.
Faria, I preferred to die on my own terms were that to be my fate.
Geralt, They say Deireadh's better guarded than the keep at Vicovaro.
Faria," They choose the guards from among witch hunters -- the worst dregs,"
Yennefer, They're allowed to drink on duty?
Faria," No-not officially, but...you know how it is."
Geralt, See? Wasn't so hard.
Yennefer, One last bit of advice -- find a new tavern. Everyone here knows
Faria," Thank you. Whatever your plans, I hope they work out."
Geralt, So do we. So long.
Geralt, What now?
Yennefer, What our friend said about the guards was interesting...
Geralt, Drinking on duty? Zoltan could make sure they have plenty of hooch.
Yennefer, Good idea. I'll search for the entrance to the ruins.
Geralt, What he said about the guards -- could prove handy.
Yennefer, True. Things will go more smoothly if we can get even a few of them
Geralt, Zoltan oughta manage it. I'll ask him.
Yennefer, Let's meet on the Oxenfurt bridge.
Geralt," They're holding Margarita in Deireadh. Got a plan to break her out, but"
Zoltan, What should I do?
Geralt, Load a wagon with as much Mahakaman as you can find and drive it to
Zoltan," Ugh, these're terrible times... Since the mages left town, the"
Geralt," Right, didn't think of that... I'll go straight to Yen, in that case."
Yennefer, Geralt!
Geralt, It's never been this bad.
Yennefer," They failed to find a way to leave Novigrad, so they made a last,"
Geralt," Street side soothsayers, chiromancers, herbalists and healers..."
Geralt, Find a way in?
Yennefer, Several. Nearest is through a well not far from here. Did you arrange
Geralt, We'll manage on our own.
Yennefer, Shall we begin?
Geralt," Actually, maybe you're right. A little help can go a long way."
Yennefer, Of course I'm right. Go. I'll wait here.
Geralt, Let's do this.
Geralt," Sure the guards don't know about the passage through the ruins, haven't"
Yennefer, They haven't.
Geralt, How can you be sure?
Yennefer, Novigrad's heirarchs have taken great care to eradicate any and all
Geralt, Hope you're right.
Yennefer, Here we are.
Geralt, This is it? Hmm... Boulder was plugging the well ring until recently.
Yennefer, Due to an edict Hemmelfart issued some years ago. But I managed to
Geralt, What is this?
Yennefer, Use it once you find Rita. I'll be able to pinpoint your location.
Geralt, Not coming?
Yennefer," Mucking through ruins and sewers, hmmm, I'd rather leave it to the"
Geralt, Meaning you'd rather waltz in once the hard work's done.
Geralt," See you inside, then."
Yennefer, Good luck.
Geralt, Wet clothes... Oh joy...
Geralt," Phew, reeks in here..."
Rita, What... What is this?
Geralt, Margarita!
Rita," Who...who's that? Geralt? Gods, I'm hallucinating..."
Geralt, Getting you outta here.
Rita, No chance. We'll both die in here.
Geralt, Síle?
Rita, They captured her first. Her condition's critical. It's pointless...
Geralt, Be right back.
Rita, What are you doing?
Geralt, Yen insisted on coming.
Yennefer, Rita! What have they done...? When I get my hands on those
Rita, I'll gladly help. If I live to see it.
Yennefer, I must take her from here. Immediately.
Yennefer, Rita? Síle?! When I get my hands on the sons of bitches...
le, Yenna... I shan't make it...
Yennefer," Hold on, you must hold on."
le," Aaaargh! I'm dying, Yenna. I'm a sorceress, let me die with dignity."
Geralt," Yen, get Rita out of here."
Yennefer, Geralt...
le," Yenna, for once, don't argue with him..."
Geralt," Yen, we should go. Nothing we can do to save her."
Yennefer, No. But we can help her die the way she wants to.
Geralt, I won't do it.
Yennefer, I will.
Yennefer," Come. We must hurry, or else we'll lose Rita, too."
Yennefer, I can't pass through the portal with you both. You'll need to get
Geralt, Don't like portals anyway. Go.
le, Funny...there was a time I'd have asked you not to do this...
Geralt," No, you'd never have asked... You're too proud..."
QUEST, FINAL PREPARATIONS |_
Ciri, Almost there.
Geralt, Where are we going exactly?
Ciri, To see Whoreson Junior.
Geralt, Wrong direction. Whoreson's headquartered on Temple Isle.
Ciri," So I thought, but I think we should check something first. Zoltan"
Geralt, Bit late for that. He's dead.
Ciri," I asked Zoltan, and he said Whoreson's alive and well on Temple Isle."
Geralt," I was there, stuck a sword in his gut."
Ciri," Your hand must've slipped, because it seems he's recovered."
Geralt, Lead the way.
Geralt, Why're you doing this again?
Ciri, I want to look him in the eyes.
Geralt, What then?
Ciri, Don't know. Depends what I see.
Sentry, What?
Geralt, Here to see Mr. Wily.
Sentry," Mr. Wily's expectin' important guests, so bugger off, you, you..."
Sentry, Turds!
Geralt," Make a deal, maybe...?"
Sentry," Eeer...yeah, yeah, a deal."
Sentry, Go on upstairs. Boss is waitin'.
Geralt, Here I thought we could do this the nice way...
Ciri," Out of the way, you louts, or we'll cut up your mugs so the girls at"
Sentry, What'd you say?
Ciri, Didn't understand? Too many syllables? Fuck off.
Sentry," Oh, you little bitch!"
Ciri, Geralt! On your left!
Sentry," You say ""Geralt""? Geralt who?"
Geralt, Of fucking Rivia.
Sentry," We-e-ell, why didn't you say that from the get-go?"
Sentry," Sorry to hassle yous -- misunderstandin', that."
Sentry, Mr. Wily's expectin' you.
Ciri, That was...strange.
Geralt, To say the least.
Ciri, I wonder what they're doing.
Geralt, We'll know soon enough.
Junior," Well, well, who do we have here? Finally found your little ward. Took"
Ciri, Seems in fine health to me.
Junior," Ahh, 'cause you thought you'd killed me that time. Surprise,"
Ciri, Enough. I'll finish what you started.
Junior," Whoa-ho, stop! It's me, Dudu! Dudu Biberveldt! You really didn't"
Ciri, Dudu?
Geralt," Wait, Ciri. After the heist, after Dijkstra's vault was emptied,"
Junior," Butchers' Yard -- the mummers' play, Priscilla's. You dragged me"
Geralt," Sheathe your sword, Ciri. It's Dudu."
Geralt," He's lying, end it."
Junior," No, wait, I tell you true!"
Ciri, Prove it.
Junior, Remember...remember when we went to steal Dijkstra's treasure? We
Junior, Gods! You gave me quite the scare!
Geralt, Not wise to play games with a witcher.
Ciri, Whoreson Junior? Was there no one else you could impersonate?
Geralt, Wouldn't have had to if you hadn't impersonated Whoreson.
Ciri, What the blazes were you thinking?
Dudu," Once we'd fled, I had no idea what to do. I could only hide for so"
Geralt," No one mourned for Whoreson Junior. In all his miserable life, he'd"
Ciri," That was courageous, Dudu. I'd never expect it from you."
Dudu," Neither would I. Oh, by the way -- you've no idea at the relief I feel"
Ciri, And I'm relieved I didn't slit your throat.
Geralt, Chose an interesting line of business.
Ciri, Dudu's always had a head for numbers. What's a few brothels and
Dudu, That's the thing -- I don't need to. Two weeks after Wily died I
Geralt, Whoreson's men didn't protest?
Dudu," I've contacts in the guilds, run a thriving trade, profits are twice"
Geralt, Be careful. You could get found out.
Dudu, Wily's men are too stupid to catch on. His colleagues ain't much
Ciri, And that might've ended very badly for you.
Dudu," True, I...get a bit carried away at times. But mostly I'm careful."
Geralt, Time's up.
Ciri," Right, we must still go by the Golden Sturgeon."
Dudu, It was nice to see you both. And take care of yourselves.
Ciri, You too.
Geralt," So long, Dudu."
Kid, Stupid old goat!
Kid, You stink!
Junior, Bugger off...little shits!
Kid, What can you do?
Kid, Hahahaha!
Geralt, Get outta here.
Ciri, Not what I thought I'd find...
Geralt, Whoreson Junior wasn't a pious man. But there came a moment when he
Geralt, Wonder what happened to him.
Ciri, We'll soon find out.
Geralt, So there is justice in this world.
Ciri," Come, let's see..."
Junior, Who...who's there?
Ciri, Remember me?
Junior, You...you cunt. You little arse-fucked whore! You...you'll pay for what
Geralt, I'd watch your words if I were you.
Junior," Wi-i-i-tche-e-r! It's all your fault! Happy, you cocksucker?! I've"
Junior, Ow! You little shit!
Ciri," On the way here, I didn't know what I'd do. Killing him was definitely an"
Geralt, Still want to?
Ciri, No. This is worse.
Geralt, Let's go.
Ciri, We've done the hardest part. Only the pleasant bits left now.
Geralt, Where're we going?
Ciri, The Golden Sturgeon. A girl who works there helped me.
Geralt, This girl we're about to see -- who is she again?
Geralt, Why're we going to the Sturgeon?
Ciri, To see a girl who helped me once.
Geralt, Who might that be?
Ciri, A friend of Dandelion's. Her name's Bea. She's a waitress at the Golden
Geralt, Risked a lot? How's that?
Ciri," The Temple Guard were breathing down my neck. If she'd been seen with me,"
Geralt, Always getting into trouble.
Ciri, I take after you.
Ciri, I visited a city once that was very much like Novigrad. But the people
Geralt, This somewhere in Zerrikania?
Ciri, No. In another world.
Geralt," Hmm... What's it like, hopping between worlds? Anything like passing"
Ciri, A bit different. It was hard going at first. I wasn't very good at
Looter, Word is you been lettin' nonhumans in your tavern again!
Bea, I admit whomever I please! You don't scare me!
Looter, Sure we don't?
Looter, Gave you a chance. Shoulda taken it.
Bea, I spit on anything you give me.
Looter," You'll regret that, you cow."
Geralt," Mind your manners, you're talking to a lady."
Looter, Stay out of this -- this is not your concern.
Geralt, Sure it is.
Looter," You're a fuckin' freak, too."
Ciri, He is. Very dangerous at that. The Butcher of White Orchard.
Looter, What'd he do there? Trim the trees?
Looter," Yugen, he slew half the village, dragged the bodies of the ealdorman"
Geralt, That's pretty good advice your friend's offering.
Looter, S-s-sorry.
Geralt, Draw your weapons. Let's get this over with.
Looter, Whoa...what?
Geralt," You're out to hurt her, I won't let you, so we'll argue and swagger"
Bea, Thank you. They seemed more determined this time.
Ciri," Shouldn't cross them, I told you."
Bea, I'm to bar nonhumans from this establishment because some thugs threaten
Ciri," So good to see you again, Bea."
Bea," And you, Ciri. Who's your charming companion?"
Geralt, Geralt of Rivia.
Bea, THAT Geralt?
Geralt, A defender of the downtrodden.
Bea, Mmm... Just so happens I was just trodden upon head to toe. Perhaps
Ciri," Bea, you strumpet, control yourself! This is Geralt!"
Bea, Ah. Aha! Why didn't you say so to start with?
Geralt, Nobody important.
Bea," I'd gladly put you up for the night. Could use a ""nobody"" like you..."
Ciri," Bea, you strumpet, control yourself! This is Geralt!"
Bea, Ah. Aha! Why didn't you say so to start with?
Bea, Mh-- Very nice to meet you. I've heard so much.
Geralt," Really? What, for example?"
Bea," For example, how you've saved her from woe so many times she's lost"
Ciri," Bea, I'm standing right here."
Bea," All right, all right."
Geralt," Ciri, didn't you have something to take care of?"
Ciri, Right.
Bea," So, what brings you here, darlings?"
Ciri, I wanted to thank you. For everything.
Bea," Oh, stop! Anyone would've done the same in my shoes!"
Ciri, Not many would've done it with such courage. Thank you. This is for you.
Bea," Oh my, it's beautiful! Thank you! So? Will you stay for stew? Innkeep"
Ciri," Thanks, but we must still visit Farcorners."
Bea," Ahh, off to see Valdo, eh? Well, shan't stop you, then. They'll feed you"
Geralt, I will. So long.
Geralt," So, your friend... Bea..."
Ciri, What about her?
Geralt," Nothing, seems nice..."
Ciri," Geraaalt, you're terrible."
Geralt, What'd I say?
Geralt, What's there to see in Farcorners?
Ciri, The camp of some traveling circus performers. Nonhumans. When I came here
Geralt, Triss didn't try to contact you?
Ciri," How could she? She didn't know anything. In fact, she thought she was to"
Geralt, Where's this friend of yours?
Ciri, Hmm... There! Valdo!
Valdo, Ciri! You devil incarnate! Where've you been?!
Aegar," Come here, darling! Hallo -- what's this? Brought your granddad?"
Ciri," Aegar, you're incorrigible. Allow me to introduce Geralt of Rivia."
Valdo," Ahh, greetings! We've heard heaps about you!"
Geralt," Mostly lies, I bet."
Valdo, If it's a lie that since her younger years you've been her friend and
Geralt, Likewise. And thanks for helping Ciri.
Valdo," Oh, we had no choice! Found it hard to refuse a lass like her!"
Valdo," Weeelll, good you're here. Come in the nick of time! We'd have been gone"
Ciri, You're leaving?
Aegar, They're to start resettling nonhumans shortly. We'd rather stay ahead of
Ciri, I understand...
Aegar," Problem is, we lost two horses, and another two are too weak to haul"
Valdo," We'll manage somehow! We don't leave till tomorrow, so naught to worry"
Aegar, Yes... For some. I'm off to see a merchant. There's a chance I can trade
Geralt, What's eating him?
Valdo," Oh, don't worry. That's just how Aegar is. Be back to his jolly old"
Geralt, Hm... Any way we can help?
Valdo," Oh, don't fret about us. We always get by somehow, right, Ciri?"
Valdo, What brings you here?
Ciri, I've come to apologize. I disappeared so suddenly then...
Valdo," Pish-posh! What matters is you're back, and you're well."
Ciri, This is for you. All that you loaned me plus a small premium.
Valdo, Ciri... You know I can't take this...
Ciri, And you know I shan't let you refuse.
Valdo, Hmm... I know! We'll make it a pot for a wager! Do you still race?
Ciri, Of course.
Valdo," Then I challenge you! Geralt, will you join us?"
Geralt, Gladly.
Valdo, A man after my own spirit! Come!
Ciri, Geralt! Choose one of these!
Geralt," Coming, coming..."
Geralt," No, thanks. Not up to it today."
Valdo," For every ache of body and soul, there's no better remedy than"
Ciri, As rain.
Valdo, Stay with us!
Valdo, You were faster once!
Ciri, Giving you a head start! Faster! You're trailing!
Geralt, Watch where you're going or you'll fall!
Ciri, Haha! Seems you've slowed!
Valdo, Just want to admire you from the side!
Geralt, Can still beat you.
Ciri, I let you win.
Valdo, Lovely race!

Valdo, Haven't raced anyone that good in a while. Haha. You're worthy
Valdo," Well, this calls for a celebration! Stay the evening! We've several"
Valdo, Bonfires to be lit soon round which all will gather! This night shall be
Ciri," Worked out nicely, don't you think?"
Geralt, What're you talking about?
Ciri," You and Triss. Never expected it, to be honest."
Geralt, Life's full of surprises.
Ciri," So, how did the two of you--?"
Geralt," End up together? Hmm. With Yen it was fight after fight, lots of"
Ciri, But what?
Geralt," Got o¹ be exhausting. With Triss, it's not. I finally feel...harmony."
Ciri," You know...perhaps it's not my concern, but...I'm glad you and Yennefer"
Geralt, Me too.
Ciri, You took your time.
Geralt, Hm. Guess we both needed a while to grapple with it.
Ciri," So what was it like? You know, when the wish lost its hold. What did"
Geralt," Hmm. Well, there we were, the two of us, on the mountain top. I"
Woman, More wine?
Ciri, Thanks. I'm glad we stayed.
Geralt, Me too. They like you here.
Ciri," I like them, too. Ahh, I've love to join them... Drink and race, travel"
Geralt, Good plan. Think I'll go with you.
Ciri," Then our future's settled. If, that is, there's more than ash left of"
Geralt," Defeating the Hunt won't be easy, but with the Lodge's support,"
Geralt, Something worrying you now?
Ciri, Ahh... What awaits us.
Geralt," Defeating the Hunt won't be easy, but with the Lodge's support,"
Geralt, Hmm... Fairytale life...but we gotta defeat the Wild Hunt first.
Ciri," I fear fighting the Hunt will only be the beginning. For me, at least."
Geralt, What do you mean?
Geralt, Don't worry about that yet. One thing at a time. You do know you can
Ciri," I do. Thank you, Geralt."
Geralt," You worry too much. What will be, will be."
Woman, Hahaha!
Man, You promised!
Woman, In jest!
Ciri, Sometimes I wish I could be like them.
Geralt," Drunk or giggly? Whichever it is, today's your chance."
Ciri," Haha, not what I meant. I'd like to be ordinary."
Geralt, Meaning?
Ciri, Ordinary.
Geralt," Me, too. Being a witcher's a burden sometimes..."
Ciri," As is my ""inheritance."" I'd so like to be ordinary."
Geralt," Problem is, you're not. You were born to greatness."
Ciri, As I've been hearing since I was born.
Geralt," Your life is yours, exclusively. You choose who you are."
Ciri," Geralt, you know that's never been true."
Ciri, All because of this damned Elder Blood! My gift -- my curse. It granted
Geralt," Then it's time to end this. Once we defeat Eredin, you'll be free."
Ciri," Really? Eredin's hardly alone. There are others, they have plans for"
Geralt," Can always renounce a gift, turn it down..."
Ciri," It's not that easy. I tried once, remember? Besides, even if doing that"
Ciri," It was the sorceresses of the Lodge once, now it's my father, even"
Geralt, You're forgetting Avallac'h...
Ciri, Avallac'h's different... He's intent on my gift not falling into the
Geralt, If you say so...
Ciri, You doubt it?
Geralt," The sooner you get rid of that illusion, the better."
Ciri, What do you mean?
Geralt, There'll come a day when Avallac'h will ask you for a favor.
Ciri," Perhaps... But if so, it will be a very, very long time from now... And"
Geralt, Hope you're right...
Ciri, That's Pablo. I plan to learn how to juggle one day.
Geralt, Incredibly useful skill.
Aegar, Finally found you two! Enjoying yourselves?
Geralt," Bonfires, wine, jugglers... What more could you ask for?"
Aegar," I could name a few things I'd trade it for, but it's a life..."
Ciri, You seem concerned. Things not go well with the merchant?
Geralt, We were. Until someone interrupted us.
Aegar," Rather prickly, this friend of yours."
Ciri, You've much in common. How did you fare with the merchant?
Geralt, I'd rather know how you fared with the merchant. Manage to get some
Aegar," Bah, lost cause. The man refused to trade, I said I'd buy, he asked"
Ciri," Ho-ho, I sense trouble..."
Aegar, I knew you'd warm to the notion. We need to sneak into the man's stable.
Ciri, Of course!
Geralt," Ehh, what can I do? Gotta help those in need..."
Ciri," Yes, yes, yes!"
Aegar," Must say, you didn't seem the type to me..."
Geralt, What type?
Aegar, Steady. Time to go! We'll meet by the stables.
Geralt, None of this concerns us.
Ciri, This does concern me. These are my friends.
Geralt, They'll manage on their own.
Aegar," If Ciri wishes to ride with us, she should. She's not your property."
Geralt, I won't let her risk her neck for thieves.
Geralt, Just buy the horses. Why can't you?
Aegar, With what coin?
Geralt, Ciri gave you a full pouch...
Aegar," Enough for one, at most. Whereas at the least we need four."
Ciri," Geralt, stop fussing. We'll not strip the merchant bare, and it's"
Geralt, Gotta be another way to solve this... Just so happens I got some coin
Aegar, We' have no way to repay you.
Geralt, Wouldn't have to.
Ciri, Shame the emperor doesn't have another daughter. We could buy all the
Aegar," A generous offer, but not one to resolve the situation. The merchant"
Geralt, I dunno. Doesn't seem like the best idea...
Ciri," Geralt, stop fussing. We'll not strip the merchant bare, and it's"
Valdo," What is this? Have you gone mad?! We were to revel, not punch each other"
Aegar, Had a falling out...with Ciri's companion.
Geralt, Should've made that clear to your friend.
Valdo," Ciri... Much as I hate to say it, I think it's time the two of you left."
Ciri," I know, the magic's gone. Sorry."
Ciri," I'm going down to the riverside. Want to take a walk, be alone for a bit."
Geralt, Sorry for that.
Ciri, You've no need to apologize for acting according to your nature. I'll
Geralt, I understand. Let's meet at Dandelion's.
Geralt," Aegar, keep a lookout. Ciri and I'll try to get inside."
Aegar, All right.
Geralt, Locked...gotta find another way in.
Geralt, Hard to find good guards these days...
Ciri," Quiet, you'll wake them."
Geralt, Hah. Here's the key. Quick get in here.
Ciri, *whistles*
Aegar, Finally!
Aegar, Whooo-hooo! We did it!
Ciri, Excellent work! Did you see the two fools who tried to chase us?
Aegar, Almost tripped over their own boots!
Ciri," Thanks, Geralt, that was splendid!"
Geralt, Yeah... A nice change from killing monsters.
Geralt, Glad to see you happy... But I don't think what we did was right.
Aegar, How can you keep the company of such a bore?
Ciri," Leave him alone, Aegar. That's just how Geralt is -- righteous."
Aegar, Thanks for your help. And for visiting.
Ciri, It was so good to see you all again. Hang in there and take care of
Aegar, Don't forget us. So long.
Ciri, I must bid Valdo farewell.
Geralt," All right. See you at Dandelion's, then. Got some things to take care"
Ciri," See you, Geralt."
QUEST, FINAL PREPARATIONS |_
Geralt," Need a hanky? Gotta admit, never expected this of you..."
h," You humans have...hm, unusual tastes. How did you fare on Bald"
Geralt, Need to ask? You're a Sage.
h, I ask as a courtesy. A concept you clearly forgot when you left
Geralt, Ciri was in a hurry.
h," I know, so she wrote in her letter. But that is not my concern. You"
Geralt, Meaning?
Geralt," Skip the guessing games, I'm tired."
h, The loss of one of his great generals has weakened Eredin.
Geralt, How do we get rid of them?
h," Caranthir is a loyalist, but Ge'els -- that is another story. He was"
Geralt, Regicide -- serious stuff... Take it not many know about this?
h," Of the living -- only I. And Eredin, of course."
Geralt," Question is, can you get Ge'els to believe you?"
h, Nothing you need worry about.
Geralt," You make it sound important. So, guess it's not exactly common"
h, I'd even call it a secret.
Geralt, How'd he manage to hide it?
h," Oh, I assure you, he's excellent at covering his tracks -- though"
Geralt, How do you know? Or are you bluffing?
h, Eredin made sure very few individuals knew of his betrayal. Most
Geralt, Didn't answer my question.
h," ""How"" matters not. What matters is I know -- and I've an idea how"
Geralt, Haven't mentioned killing Ge'els...
h, Such drastic means are not always necessary.
Geralt," So, you probably plan to offer him a deal."
h," Brilliant deduction, bravo."
Geralt," Wanna deal, talk to him, trust him? I'd rather just kill him."
h, That is precisely one of the reasons why Ge'els abhors your
Geralt," Fine, so what do you propose?"
h," Why, to bring Ge'els here, show him the truth of what happened."
Geralt, Fabulous plan -- if we only knew where to find him.
h, We do. In the land of the Aen Elle.
Geralt, Think you're forgetting something -- you and Ciri might know how to
h, You clearly know there are many other worlds apart from the one
Geralt," Elven Sages, for example?"
Geralt, Land of the Aen Elle?
h," You don't recall? After all, you did travel with Eredin for some"
h," For example. One such passage will open soon, near where we are,"
Geralt, Let's go.
Geralt, Meet you there. Gotta see to something along the way.
h, Hurry. I'd rather not loiter in the street any longer than
Geralt, I know this house. Supposed to drive a godling from here.
h, Supposed to?
Geralt, Decided it was harmless.
h," The passage is here, past this wall."
h," This is the place. Once we enter, there'll be no returning until we"
Geralt," Yes, let's go."
h," Remember, wherever you land, search for a place that looks like this"
Geralt, Mean we'll be separated?
h, It's possible. I lack your ward's talents. Zireael is the Lady of
Geralt, I hate portals.
Geralt, Where are we?
h, Welcome to the Ddiddiwedht Desert.
Geralt, This somewhere in our world?
h," Ever seen such canyons in your world? Come, we must go."
Geralt, What is this place?
h," A very old world, thoroughly raped and destroyed."
Geralt, Anything live here?
h, Mainly desert creatures able to survive months on end without water.
Geralt, And before? Were there any...people? Or elves?
h, Do you believe humanoids have a monopoly on destroying worlds?
Geralt, So what did live here? Sentient monsters of some sort?
h, Look at those cliffs. Remind you of anything?
Geralt, Hmm... Looks a bit like the bed of a giant river.
h, Or the bottom of a sea.
Geralt, Mean there were water creatures here once?
h, No creatures. Merely a sea.
Geralt, Trying to say that...?
h," That there are many different worlds, and even more forms of life."
h," Ah, the portal."
Geralt, Looks more like a ruin.
h, Appearances can be deceiving.
Geralt, So what're we waiting for?
h, For it to open. Shouldn't take but a few moments.
Geralt, What's going on?
h, The sandcrabs have sensed our presence.
Geralt, Wonderful.
Geralt, They just keep coming!
h," We can't hope to defeat them all! As soon as the portal opens, you"
Geralt, What a relief.
h, Quickly! Jump in!
Geralt, Avallac'h?
Geralt, There it is.
Geralt, Vapors don't look terribly inviting.
Geralt," Akh kha ah... Akh akh. Dammit, gotta hold my breath. Any longer and"
Geralt, Brrr... Cold.
Geralt, Freeze to death if I don't hide somewhere. And I gotta find that next
Geralt," Light, in a place like this? Someone must've lit it. With any luck, it"
Geralt, Course... What else? Might've expected this.
h, Took you a while. Did you run into trouble?
Geralt," Erm, no. Just taking in the sights. What is this place? Feels like I've"
h," You have. You fought Eredin's projection here. Before that, Ciri"
Geralt, What're you talking about?
h, Ever wondered how you managed to leave the Red Riders?
Geralt," Many times, but I don't remember a thing."
h," Ciri came for you. She sensed you were in danger, tore you from the"
Geralt, Did Eredin start hunting her because of that? Because of me? Why didn't
h, Ugh. What would it have changed?
Geralt," Doesn't look safe here, either. Let's go."
h, This way.
Geralt, Next passage -- when will it open?
h, Shortly.
Geralt, Where are we? World of the Aen Elle?
h," No. This is Tedd Deireadh, the Time of the End. The world"
Geralt, So calm when you say that...
h, Eredin succumbed to his knowledge of the apocalypse. Fear rules
Geralt, Care to clarify?
h," Not here, not now."
Geralt," Going after Ge'els is proving quite a trek, but I still don't know"
h, Eredin differs from the king he killed. Power for its own sake
Geralt, He got any weaknesses?
h, Yes. He's righteous.
Geralt, I was hoping we wouldn't get separated.
h, I warned you it could happen.
Geralt, Where'd your journey take you?
h, Through a world whose sun had just died. I barely reached the next
Geralt, Light on the peak -- was that you?
h," I thought it might aid your passage. After all, that is what"
h, At last.
Geralt, Is this Tir ná Lia?
h," The Palace of Awakening, formerly the Moon Palace. Ge'els'"
Geralt, Hmm...beautiful.
h, I'm glad to know you appreciate it. Elven architecture is a bit more
Woman, Oh? Who's this? And why are they here?
els," I believe we're done for the day, my tulip. Be a dear and leave us"
h," Her height, perhaps. Nothing more."
els," Ah, I see I've touched on a tender spot... So let's change the subject,"
Geralt," Got any vodka? Oh, yeah, keep forgetting you don't touch that filth,"
Geralt, Didn't come here for tea.
els," Hm... I must admit, you appearing here -- quite the surprise, witcher."
Geralt, I think that even among the Aen Elle elves there are those capable
els, Naïvety's a fool's blessing...
Geralt," No. But honesty's not a facet of your species. So quit spewing bile,"
els," I detect a shadow of impatience in your faces, it seems. So, what"
h, I've come to tell you who killed our king.
els, You've gone through a great deal of trouble to reach me... So I must
h, You shall see the truth. You will dream it.
els, You've an oneiromancer? Hmph. My intuition was correct -- this will be
Geralt, Tired of your pseudo-sophisticated courtesy. Let's go.
els," Where to, if I might ask?"
Geralt," Better believe it. This way, please."
els," Witcher Geralt, a true man of action. Might I know where we're going?"
h," To the world of the Aen Seidhe. Directly, this time."
Geralt, Let's go. Before any guards show up.
h, I take it I needn't introduce our guest.
els," Greetings, Zireael. So it's true -- the Swallow has befriended the Fox."
Ciri, There's naught you can do to make us turn on one another.
els, Avallac'h blackmailed you -- do you not remember? Tried to force you to
Ciri, I remember. But I also remember what you advised Eredin do with me once
els," I didn't come here to argue. The proof you promised, where is it?"
h, You will see it. In your dream.
els," Ah yes, the oneiromancer. Visions that cannot be fabricated. Do you"
Geralt," Don't flatter yourself. Defy Eredin, that's all you need to do."
Geralt, You'll do what you want. If you decide to continue serving the
els, Very well. Have your oracle summon dreams of my king's last moments.
h, We shall all dream them. To make certain there are no
els, Why not.
Eredin, The king is dead. Long live the king.
els," You must face him on your terms, in this world, in a place of your"

Ciri, Calm down. Avallac'h knows him better. We'll hear him out when he
Geralt, Speak of the devil.
Ciri, Geralt's worried. He believes we let Ge'els go too easily.
Geralt," He got off cheap and easy... Sold us a few pieces of advice, some"
h, He gave us his assurance that he'll not support Eredin. And that
Geralt, Can never be too careful.
h," Agreed. Yet I do believe Ge'els will keep his word, withhold"
Ciri, Seems to me you have a plan. Care to share it with us?
h," Once we find the Sunstone, aided by your sorceresses and their"
Geralt, Just like that?
h," Defeating Eredin will be no small feat, but we will accomplish it."
QUEST, FINAL PREPARATIONS |_
Triss," You're here, finally."
Geralt, What do we do?
Triss," You've got to approach the guards. I...they could recognize me, I'd"
Geralt, Right. You stay here.
Geralt, What was her crime?
Sentry, Same as all of 'em. Witchcraft and fornication with succubi!
Sentry, Cunt tried to seduce Radovid. But he saw through her. Showed her what
Geralt, Take your friend and go for a walk.
Sentry, Perhaps we've earned a break...
Sentry," Aye, high time..."
Geralt, Get outta here. Both of you.
Sentry, Don't rightly believe you know who you're talking to.
Geralt," Oh, I do -- two idiots. Soon to be two dead idiots."
Geralt, Here to take the body.
Sentry, First we've heard of anyone collecting it.
Sentry," Guard the witch, those're our orders."
Geralt, So long.
Triss, I'll take her somewhere safe. Then wait for you outside the Passiflora.
Geralt, Sure you don't need any help?
Triss, Don't trouble yourself.
Geralt, See you.
Triss, How'd it go?
Yennefer," No casualties, so not bad, I suppose."
Triss, Ciri can handle herself... Gets it from you... Since it seems to be
Yennefer," Yes, good idea."
Yennefer," Geralt... Geralt, wake up."
Geralt, Wh...what? Yen? Something wrong?
Triss, Wake up. Sit with us a while.
Geralt," Triss? You here too? What's, uh, going on?"
Triss, We need to tell you something.
Geralt, You two are acting strange...
Yennefer, Us? No...
Geralt, Something's not right. What're you up to?
Triss, Don't be nervous.
Triss," Yen and I, well, we talked and concluded..."
Yennefer, ...That we've wasted much too much time fighting...over you.
Triss," Meanwhile, we'll probably soon face the Wild Hunt, most likely battle"
Yennefer," So, we decided we must try to make the most of the time we have left."
Geralt, Together? Go on...
Geralt, I don't like this...
Yennefer, You soon will...
Triss," We've always loved each other, you're in love with us..."
Yennefer, There's no point in fighting it. We must enjoy what we have.
Triss, So we've prepared...something special.
Yennefer, Come by the Kingfisher this evening...
Triss, Bring wine. Lots of wine.
Yennefer," See you later, love."
Triss, I can't wait.
Geralt, This'll be interesting...
Yennefer, I'd lost hope that you'd appear.
Triss, We couldn't wait for you to show.
Geralt, What about me? Don't I get any?
Triss, You...
Yennefer, ...just got exactly what you deserve.
Geralt, Hey! This isn't funny!
Geralt, Come back! Triss! Yen!
Dandelion," Haha. Well, well. Ladies did quite a number on you."
Geralt, Save it. I'm not in the mood...
Dandelion," Well, I sure am. What'd you play? ""Tame the fiend?"" Or was it"
Geralt, You know about this?
Dandelion," No, they didn't tell me till this morning. A shame, really,"
Geralt, Do a number on you if you don't...
Dandelion," In your shoes, my friend, I'd be promising mounds of gold, not"
Geralt," Untie me now, or you'll need that gold to replace your teeth."
Dandelion, Haha. You'd have to catch me first. And you don't exactly look
Geralt, Dandelionnnn...
Dandelion," All right, all right. Sorry, don't often see you like this,"
Geralt, Triss and Yen -- where are they? Got something to say to them...
Geralt, Got what I deserved... Should've known it was too good to be true...
Dandelion, You certainly should have.
Geralt, Tell anyone about this and...
Dandelion," Calm down, won't peep a word. It's one thing to laugh at a friend,"
Dandelion," Oh, Geralt, how little you know about women... Did you really think"
Geralt," Think I'll pass. I'm off to see Avallac'h. Wanted a word, apparently..."
Philippa," Yennefer, if this is untrue..."
Yennefer," It's true. Help protect Ciri from the Wild Hunt, and the emperor will"
Rita, I hope we can trust you.
Yennefer, You can.
Rita, What of Fringilla?
Yennefer, That I don't know... But I shall take it up with him.
Geralt, You've barely said hello and you're already plotting something.
Yennefer, It's clearly in our nature.
Geralt, Bit about Fringilla -- what was that? Triss told me you couldn't
Yennefer," Perhaps because she sits in the emperor's dungeon, chained in"
Geralt, How's Rita know? Barely got out of prison herself.
Yennefer, She spoke to Fringilla before they imprisoned her. Fringilla said
Geralt, Thought this kinda drama only happened around Radovid.
Geralt, Hmm... Take it the emperor forgot to tell you about this?
Geralt, I hear right? You convince the emperor to pardon them?
Yennefer, Provided they help us defend Ciri.
Geralt, Hmm... Got a hard time believing emperor'd go in for a deal like
Yennefer," If you can't believe it, don't. I don't need you to."
Yennefer," I don't like it. That was not our deal. When it's all over, I'll need"
h, All are present. You were the last to arrive. Might we set sail?
Geralt, Anchors aweigh.
Geralt," Wait here, forgot something."
Yennefer," Well, that settles the question of His Imperial Majesty's"
Ciri, Does he aim to conquer Skellige? But he knows...those are my friends!
Yennefer, He wishes to grant you the isles. With Cintra...and the rest of the
Triss, There is an upside to all this.
Ciri, Is that so?
h, The emperor will have to help us fight the Hunt. And we've just
Ciri, We must hurry and find the Sunstone. Seems we've plenty to do in Skellige
Yennefer, Fringilla Vigo -- we need her here.
Geralt, Can you teleport me onto Emhyr's ship?
Yennefer, Not a chance. It's better shielded than the emperor's alcove.
Triss, Though we could try to force our way through...
h, We need Fringilla in one piece.
Geralt, I'll get on the emperor's ship myself.
Triss, Plan to swim? With swords on your back? You'll get shot up like a
Yennefer," Don't panic. He'll find a way. Make your approach by night, you'll"
Geralt, Think they know we're here?
Yennefer, Emhyr's mages? Of course.
Geralt," If the matter of Fringilla Vigo were resolved, they'd probably just"
Yennefer, It's far from resolved. The emperor pledged to ensure the Lodge's
Triss," Fringilla is a pricklier matter. She's his subject, one officially"
Yennefer, You'll need to learn what Emhyr has planned for her -- once we've
Geralt, At the moment we don't even know what the Sunstone is.
h, It was created so the Mountain Elves could summon the vessels of
Geralt, The Sunstone's in Skellige? How do we know that?
h, From legends. Elven ones. It lies where the White Fleet landed
Yennefer, Meaning anywhere on any one of the Isles. Splendid...
Geralt, Ermion -- I'll talk to him.
Yennefer, Know where he is?
Geralt, I'll ask around the port. Crach's longships are moored there.
Geralt, What I wanna know is if we'll be able to use the Sunstone.
h, You? No. Me? Naturally. With a touch of help from the
Yennefer," Of whom some are below deck vomiting, while others remain"
Geralt," Tell us, please. Absolutely love elven legends."
h, Gealbhan was a Sage of the Alder Elves. He fell in love with an
Ciri, Ahem. That was a jest on Geralt's part?
h, Too late. It won't hurt any of you to know this. On the day the
Yennefer, Sounds promising. Let's just hope this Sunstone proves more useful
Geralt, I'm off.
Ciri, Good luck.
Yennefer, Perhaps you should talk to him after all.
Ciri, What would be the point? Surely none now.
Yennefer, And later? Don't count your father out just because he's the world's
Ciri, ...authoritarian rotter unworthy of even one inch of trust?
Yennefer," Actually, of all people, I believe you can trust him, perhaps you"
Ciri, What about the dictatorial rotter part?
Yennefer, Something to get used to.
Yennefer, I thought you wished to see Crach?
Ciri," It's just that... What if I disappear again tomorrow? For good this time,"
Triss, We can always drop you back on the Isle of Mists.
Ciri, Heh. Thanks a lot.
Rita, Do you know what I just realized?
Philippa, Hm?
Rita," Except for the two of us and Ciri, Geralt has slept with every woman on"
Philippa," Don't worry, it's only a matter of time in your case."
Philippa, Well? What is it?
Geralt," No need to thank me, Philippa. Always glad to save your ass. You're"
Philippa, You stood to gain -- that is why you saved me.
Geralt," Way back when, did you really send assassins after Dijkstra?"
Philippa, You believe I...? Do you not remember we were once lovers?
Geralt," Maybe it's just me, but I think you'd consider that in itself to be"
Philippa," Ahh, you see, Geralt, there are those who keep politics separate"
Geralt, Which one was Dijkstra?
Philippa, The more boring of the two.
Geralt, Farewell.
Geralt, How're you feeling?
Rita," Better, I thank you. If you'd not arrived in time, things might have"
Geralt," Thank Yennefer. It was her idea, her plan."
Geralt, Thought Margarita Laux-Antille'd be among the last to get nabbed by
Rita," Were it dependent solely on me, of course I would have. But you forget"
Geralt, Didn't see any other sorceresses in there with you...
Rita, Because they'd already been executed. Burned...alive...one after the
Geralt," If you're here, what's become of Aretuza?"
Rita," The day I arrived in Novigrad, I received a message from Biruta Icarti."
Geralt," No reaction from the Council, the Conclave?"
Rita," Do you jest? They asked Radovid to ""intervene."" Just after he'd"
Geralt," Farewell, Rita."
Fringilla," Yes, Geralt?"
Geralt, You look good.
Fringilla, For a captive of Emhyr -- is that what you mean?
Geralt," Seems like he's shown you surprising...leniency. No interrogations,"
Fringilla," If I'd told him everything, he'd hardly still need me alive,"
Geralt, So long.
Yennefer, We looked around your laboratory.
h, I never doubted you would. But why did you? You might've just asked.
Yennefer, To hear you reveal all about your experiments with the Elder Blood
h, I've hidden nothing that could be useful in our struggle against
Yennefer, Or maybe you're just obsessed with her?
h, I'm obsessed?
Geralt, Went by your laboratory.
h, I trust you did not make a mess.
Geralt, Didn't mention you were the Aen Elle elves' chief source of knowledge
h," I didn't mention many things. Fortunately, they're no longer"
Geralt," Your experiments with the gene, Elder Blood -- that's not important?"
h, I pursued those studies to protect Ciri. To protect Lara Dorren's
Geralt, Ran into someone at your lab.
h," Did you, now?"
Geralt, Mhm. A she-elf. Claimed you hate Ciri. So how's that fit you trying
h, Not at all. You don't really expect me to confess my feelings to
Geralt, So maybe you're hoping to gain control of Lara herself? After all
h, Lara is dead. My only hope is that Ciri will fulfill her calling
Geralt, I believe you.
h, I know. You'd never let me within five hundred yards of Ciri
Geralt, We found the Sunstone.

Geralt, Won't keep Eredin waiting that long.
h, It seems we've everything. We can go. Keep in mind -- once we
Geralt, I'm ready. High time we set sail. Undvik awaits.
Geralt, See you on Undvik.

Soldier, Sink the boat! Shoot!
Geralt, Wait! Parley! I'm a-- Dammit!
Soldier, Hold! It's the witcher! Emperor's orders! Stand down!
Emhyr, Witcher. What a pleasant surprise.
Geralt," Warm welcome. Thank you, Your Majesty."
Emhyr," We are at war, if you haven't noticed."
Geralt, I've noticed. Can see the smoke from burning huts miles away.
Emhyr," You should have come with my daughter, your welcome would have been"
Geralt, Close.
Emhyr," Close, White Wolf, is what you are to decapitation."
Geralt, In Zerrikania. She longed for sunlight.
Emhyr, I am known neither for my sense of humor nor for my patience.
Emhyr, You're insolent because you believe I cannot afford to hurt you. And
Emhyr, What do you want?
Geralt, Fringilla Vigo. Been told you promised Yennefer you'd free her. I can
Emhyr, Hm... Even Yennefer's humblest requests seem like threats. I've always
Geralt, Time I was on my way.
Emhyr," At last, a point we agree on. Guards! Bring me Fringilla Vigo! You may"
Geralt, Truly prepared to forgive them? Amnesty in exchange for help?
Emhyr, I'm prepared to abide by the agreement I made with Yennefer.
Geralt, Didn't answer my question.
Emhyr, Nor must I.
Emhyr, No introductions are necessary from what I've heard. Farewell.
Geralt," Fringilla... Been a while. The other sorceresses, they're on Gynvael,"
Fringilla, I'm sick to death of boats.
Geralt, And I despise teleports. But have it your way. Let's go.
Philippa, Look what the cat dragged in! Fringilla Vigo!
Fringilla, Philippa. A pleasure as always.
Yennefer," Come now, we need none of that. Fringilla, we must speak."
Philippa, Oh my.
Triss, Fringilla!
Fringilla, Triss... Where's Yennefer?
Triss, She'll be here soon. And she's sure to want to talk to you.
Fringilla, I don't doubt it.
Fringilla, And truly you could do nothing? At all? For six whole months?
Philippa, Why don't you tell me about the emperor. He's apparently become
Rita, Philippa...
Philippa, What?
Rita, Want a cracker?

Crach," Wolf, do you see? The black dogs in their rickety tubs! They bay at our"
Geralt, Saw 'em all. Where's Ermion?
Crach, Went to see Lugos. An an Craite on the throne remains a thorn in his
Geralt, Think I'll join Ermion. Need to talk to him.
Crach," Go. And when you see that bloody twit Lugos, be sure to tell him-- Argh,"
Madman, And what else would Crach have? He not content to have the mightiest
Ermion, Under present circumstances--
Madman, Under present circumstances Crach can go ahead and reap the shite he

Madman, I'd sooner aid the wraiths of bleedin' Mörhogg than let Crach rule all
Ermion," And your men, what do they say? Will they follow you when the jarls"
Madman," This here's my land, druid! Watch your words!"
Geralt," What would you call it, if not treason?"
Geralt, Would you be king by Nilfgaard's grace?
Madman, That your bark before you bite? Did Crach send you here for my head?
Ermion," Come, we should not stay here."
Ermion," Well, Geralt, I can see no row can occur in Skellige without your"
Geralt," Mean and inaccurate, Ermion. Seems to me I've missed quite a few."
Ermion," The blood of Crach's blood sits upon the throne, and that is your"

Ermion," So, Clan Drummond will attack sooner than we expected, it seems."
Geralt, Thought Crach sent you to negotiate an agreement with Lugos.
Ermion, Hah! An agreement! Only Crach believes such a thing possible at this
Geralt, Mean I didn't actually ruin things for you?
Ermion," Not this time. Lugos' death stands to change a great deal. His cousin,"
Geralt," Listen, Ermion. Know anything about the Sunstone? Legends place it"
Ermion," The Mask of Uroboros first, now the Sunstone. Monsters may rest easy"
Geralt, Where will I find him?
Ermion," Today? In Arinbjorn, doubtless. You might also ask the pearl divers"
Geralt, Fishlung? Interesting.
Ermion, So they call him. Submerges for hours at a time. None know how he
Geralt, Hm. Not too fond of him?
Ermion, It's nothing personal. I couldn't stand his father or grandfather
Geralt, Thanks for your help.
Ermion," One thing, Geralt. These caves or ruins -- Matthias' and Erling's"
Geralt," Whole gaggle, this time."
Ermion, Ugh! Gods protect us.
Geralt, Hjalmar handling things all right?
Ermion, Lad's developed quite a taste for heroic adventures. Left ruling the
Geralt, And Cerys?
Ermion, I would say she's being more useful than Hjalmar.
Geralt, How's Cerys handling things?
Ermion," Has the makings of an excellent queen, if she would only flee her"
Geralt, And Hjalmar?
Ermion, The lad's led three raids against the imperial fleet. All against
Geralt," Yeah, sounds like Hjalmar."
Eyvind, Not now!
Geralt, Watching for Nilfgaard's fleet?
Eyvind," Fleet? Oh, aye, they mentioned something... Nay, I've more important"
Geralt, Let's watch for Gevorg together. And you can tell me what you know
Geralt, What's this whale about?
Eyvind," He's to appear when specters descend from the heavens into the waves,"
Geralt," Legends don't happen to mention a Curse of the Black Sun, do they?"
Eyvind, Black sun? What're you on about?
Geralt, Never mind.
Geralt, Heard of some cavern no one's been able to enter?
Eyvind," Good thing, too. Elsewise they'd 'ave plundered it long ago, like all"
Eyvind," Hah! Can tell by your mug I was right! And to think, didn't take you"
Geralt, I just wanna look around the cavern. Research.
Geralt, Eyvind!
Eyvind, What?
Geralt," I...ugh, just wanted to assure you I only want to look around the"
Eyvind, Research?
Geralt, Writing a historical treatise on the Aen Seidhe elves. Under Ermion's
Eyvind, Ermion? Man never cared a whit about the Elves of the Mountains.
Geralt, Ugh...
Geralt, Writing an adventure novel. Gathering material for it.
Eyvind, Mean to write up the comin' of the White Fleet? Prime idea. Mayhaps
Geralt," Gladly, gladly. So, where's this cavern?"
Eyvind," Gotta sail east from Kaer Trolde. Cavern's in a cove, only"
Geralt, So long. And...good luck with the white whale.
Eyvind, It'll show today. I'm sure of it.
Geralt, Must be the pearl divers' boat.
Matthias," Look, Erling. Told you we wasn't done for the day. Didn't even have"
Erling, You daft? Can't you see he's a witcher?
Matthias, What's a witcher doin' here?
Geralt, Run outta pearls?
Erling," Not your concern. What the sea gives, we take."
Geralt, Seems she's a reluctant giver.
Matthias," Aye, I could use a better knife. But a few hours and their fingers"
Geralt, Never heard of Skelligers looting fallen warriors. That a tradition?
Matthias," You not have eyes? Whaddaya mean, our own? These are Faroe scum!"
Erling, Went after the Black Ones with two longships. Fishbrains!
Geralt, Listen. Heard you know a thing or two about elven ruins in Skellige.
Matthias, Who says?
Geralt, Ermion.
Matthias," Hm. You'll not tell 'im what you saw today, will ya?"
Geralt, Depends.
Erling," Elven ruins, you say? What do you want to know?"
Geralt, Druid mentioned some cavern you've never been able to enter. Where
Matthias," East of Kaer Trolde, in a cove you can only reach from the sea."
Erling," We got nothin' else for you, so if you're done, we'd rather get back"
Geralt, I'm done. And good idea.
Geralt," Plan to return the bodies to their families at least? I mean, once"
Matthias, You speak true -- mutants got nothin' resemblin' refined
Erling, And that's that.
Geralt, Risking a lot.
Matthias, Why? That a threat or somethin'?
Geralt, Don't need to worry about me. But I heard calls underwater. Monsters
Matthias, Huh. I-I don't...hear nothin'.
Geralt, Ordinary folk never hear these things...till it's too late.
Erling," We best get outta here, Matthias."
Yennefer," I'd rather verify it now. Otherwise, I'll continue to wonder if he's"
Philippa, You've something of a persecution complex.
Yennefer, You needn't come with us.
Philippa, I hadn't intended.
Geralt, Going somewhere?
Yennefer, Ciri says there's a site in Skellige we must examine. Avallac'h's
Ciri," Earlier, when we were in the Isles together, Avallac'h mentioned a"
Yennefer," Sufficiently suspicious, don't you think?"
Geralt, So what? Wanna just sneak in and root around?
Ciri, Exactly. Coming with?
Geralt, Making too much of it. Avallac'h's as secretive as any elf. What're
Ciri," I...don't know, Geralt. I've a feeling it's important. Come with us."
Geralt, Fine. Where is it?
Ciri, On a small isle between Undvik and Spikeroog.
Geralt, Not exactly on our way. Just found out the Sunstone's on Ard Skellig.
Philippa, Go find this laboratory. I will explore Ard Skellig. You can join me
Yennefer," Philippa, your eyesight -- only just recovered and magically"
Philippa, Did I?
Yennefer," I'd forgotten how irritating she can be. Come, Ciri. We'll await you"
Geralt, Just wonderful.
Philippa," I say, look at this!"
Geralt, Let's go.
Geralt," What now? Gonna grow yourself some new eyes, like Vilgefortz did? I"
Philippa, I take it your mention of that deviant is purely coincidental?
Geralt," Course. Also heard of this rich, blind dwarf from Mahakam...had them"
Geralt, Hear that?
Philippa, Mhm.
Siren, Arhaaam shinaaaz!
Geralt, What'd she just say?
Philippa, You're not her type.
Geralt," Drowners were protecting her. Damn, there's a lot..."
Philippa," I hope you don't plan to muck about in this carrion, now. We came"
Geralt, Hm. So how do we get up the--
Philippa, The stairs? I'll fix them right away.
Philippa, Ready.
Geralt, Let's go.
Philippa, Couldn't help noticing the tension between you and Yennefer and
Geralt," Yeah, so if you're angling to make it a fivesome, there's clearly no"
Geralt, What now?
Philippa, It appears I must do everything for you. See the sentry who seems to
Geralt, I'm fresh out of change.
Philippa," Ugh. In blood, not coin. The sentry if Fiallan, of the elven legend."
Philippa, There you are.
Philippa, Yennefer must have tremendous pull with the emperor. To get him to
Geralt," My take? Obviously a leading question. No ""Geralt, I'm tired, let's sit"
Philippa, Is foreplay that important to you?
Geralt, This deal with Emhyr -- it's sorceress business. Pick someone else's
Philippa, So she's not told you anything? What about personal plans? Has she
Geralt, Stay away from Ciri.
Philippa," She's an adult, Geralt. You keep forgetting. She can decide for"
Geralt, You oughta talk to Yennefer. Painfully clear there's unfinished
Philippa, Yennefer's always walked her own path. I'm actually touched she

Philippa," I'd sooner stick my head in a zeugl's spiky orifice. Thanks, but"
Geralt, You'll get to work with the emperor. Not excited?
Philippa," No. I-I mean, yes, of course I am. Thus far the Lodge has oft"
Geralt, Hm... So you're impressed Emhyr keeps his mages on a short leash.
Philippa, Yennefer's wise to keep you out of politics. I'm afraid you'd not
Philippa, Don't you think it's time you stopped interfering in Ciri's life?
Geralt, No.
Philippa, But you do know we're not a pack of wolves you can just drive away
Geralt," Sure you are, and yes, I can. If the need arises."
Philippa," Wait, there's something here. Feel it?"
Geralt, No. My medallion--
Philippa, A ridiculous bauble. Don't make me laugh. Tuning into elven magic is
Geralt, Uh-huh.
Philippa, That means the Sunstone is here. Don't stand there looking stupid.
Philippa, The scan's echo is strongest here.
Philippa, Found it! At laaast...
Geralt," Hand it over, and let's get outta here."
Philippa, Not so fast. We've a matter to discuss.
Geralt, Lemme guess -- you gotta fly. You're about to tell me why you need the
Philippa, No idea where you got such a ridiculous notion. Ciri's safety is most
Geralt, You'll like Nilfgaard -- no two ways about it. I recommend the fresh
Philippa," Hahah, and Yennefer claims you have no sense of humor. Now listen"
Geralt," Wouldn't worry. Emperor's got plans for you, I'm sure."
Philippa, Stop playing the jester and listen to me carefully.
Philippa," Once we've defeated the Hunt and Ciri is safe, Yennefer's meteoric"
Geralt, You're telling me this because...?
Philippa," If I know even one bit, I expect that once we've defeated the Wild"
Geralt, Triss might object.
Philippa," Ah, yes. So give Yennefer some friendly advice, would you? She'll"
Geralt, Any other words of wisdom? Or can we go?
Philippa, You may go. I know you've things to do. I shall find my own way
Geralt, You want to take Yen's place at Emhyr's side.
Philippa, And at Ciri's. I think you understand it's inevitable. And I would
QUEST, BATTLE PREPARATIONS |_
Yennefer, Entrance is very well protected. I believe we'll find something
Ciri, How will you lift the barrier?
Yennefer, Atlan Kerk's inclusion should do the trick. Remember the spell?
Ciri," I remember you teaching me. And to think I thought you an overbearing,"
Yennefer," Now, now. This is no time to get soppy."
Geralt, So? Any incriminating letters? Closets full of skeletons?
Ciri, We've not even opened the door yet.
Yennefer, It's a highly complex magic barrier. Let's try... Geata'ar ligen!
Ciri, We've awoken a sentry.
Geralt, I'll take care of him.
Yennefer, I shall try to get through the barrier.
Yennefer, Come.
Geralt, Pretty cozy. Doesn't look much of a lab at all.
Yennefer, That proves nothing. We must look around.
Ciri," It's a bit low, isn't it? Rummaging through his papers?"
Yennefer," You wished to come, my dear."
Geralt," Portrait of Ciri, I think."
Ciri," No, that's not me. Where's the scar?"
Geralt," It's definitely you. Hm, really captured you. Sure Avallac'h's only"
Ciri, Pfff. Very funny.
Yennefer," Look, Geralt!"
Yennefer, It seems someone was literally just here...
Geralt, Avallac'h's on the ship. We know that.
Yennefer, What if he's not...?
Geralt, Stop.
Geralt," Avallac'h's assistant, maybe?"
Yennefer," No, somehow doesn't seem like Avallac'h to have one."
Geralt, Hm. A distillate? Smells like...
Yennefer, Verbena.
Geralt, Herbs. Not very incriminating.
Yennefer, Wait. We've not examined the entire laboratory yet.
Ciri, Riannon. Amvet. Finoa. Corbett the Cintrian. Muriel. Adalia. Calanthe.
Geralt," Yen! Genealogical chart of the Aen Hen Ichaer, the Elder Blood. From"
Ciri, To me. You never showed me the full version. I had no idea Videmont of
Yennefer," Him of the daughters. My, even I'd never seen the full version. Seems"
Geralt, Forget this. Not like we're gonna learn anything new.
Yennefer, How can you know?
Ciri, I don't wish to read this either.
Geralt, Let's look at his notes.
Yennefer, Gods... He's spent over two centuries on this. He was the first to
Ciri, Meaning what exactly? That I ought to be looking about for giant jars
Yennefer," Don't be foolish! Avallac'h never got that far. Apparently, all his"
Ciri, And that's why we've the Wild Hunt to contend with. Let's ferret on --
Geralt, He's only analyzing -- really believe that? If he's anything like our
Yennefer, I don't think we'll ever know if or how deeply the elves have
Ciri, Did you have a hand in...in what Geralt mentioned? The work of those
Yennefer, Of course not.
Yennefer, Someone's there. Beyond the door...
Woman, How did you get in here?
Geralt, Who are you?
Woman, Not your concern. Get out of here. Now.
Geralt, We mean you no harm.
Woman, I care not at all why you're here. Get out.
Ciri, You...I remember you. From Tir ná Lia.
Woman, Remarkable. I thought all elves looked alike to those of your race. If
Ciri, I know.
Woman, And yet you come here? What for? To spy on him? He tries his damndest
Ciri, What can you possibly know about that?
Woman, You'd be surprised. He's told me a great deal about you.
Geralt, Like what?
Geralt," Ciri, let's get out of here."
Ciri, No. I want to listen.
Woman, He said you shared Lara's features -- I don't see whatever it is he
Yennefer, What task?
Woman, Do you think he trails you everywhere for pleasure? Even I grow ill at
Yennefer, It's incredible how those like you still believe you're superior to
Woman, She's no human. She's a degenerate half-breed. To have no choice but to
Yennefer, Another world and I'll--
Woman, What? You'll change nothing. She must do what she must. Then Avallac'h
Geralt," If he hates me so deeply, why didn't he just tell me to my face?"
Geralt, Avallac'h means that much to you?
Ciri, What's that got to do with anything?
Geralt," Ciri, you didn't actually believe her, did you? She's, uh..."
Ciri, What of it?
Ciri," If they despise me so, they should leave me be!"
Yennefer, Ciri...
Ciri, What?! Do you fear I'll level this place like I did Kaer Morhen? Shame I
Geralt, Calm down. The elf was right.
Ciri, Argh. Aren't you supposed to cheer me up?
Geralt, You carry Lara's gene -- nothing you can do about it. Inherited her
Ciri, Certainly didn't seem so.
Geralt, You were born with a great gift. And only you can decide how to use
Ciri, Ha-rah!
Geralt, Ugh!
Ciri, Eeeeeeerrrgh!
Geralt, Aaa-argh!
Ciri, There. That's better. Let's get out of here.
Ciri, What's that?
Geralt, A necklace. Lara Dorren's.
Ciri," It's beautiful, but..."
Geralt," Yours, to wear..."
Ciri, Let's go. I'm sick of this place.
Ciri, Must we return to the boat right away?
Geralt, Something else you wanna see?
Ciri," Not here. On Hindarsfjall. In Lofoten. I met a young man, Skjall, and I'd"
Yennefer," Ciri, Skjall is dead."
Ciri, The Wild Hunt... Everyone...? No one survived?
Yennefer, Skjall died later.
Ciri, You sure it was him? You'd met him?
Yennefer, I was there. I saw his body.
Ciri, Will you visit his grave with me? I'd like to...say goodbye.
Geralt, I'll go with you.
Ciri, Thank you. Could you open a portal -- to Hindarsfjall?
Yennefer, I can.
Geralt, Let's do this.
Yennefer," Come back soon, all right?"
Ciri, Mhm. See you.
Geralt," You can take that alone, Ciri. Meet you on Hindarsfjall."
Ciri, As you wish. I'll be at the graveyard.
Yennefer," Please get it done quickly. And Ciri, try not to get into any"
Ciri, Certainly don't plan to. See you.
Geralt," Ciri, no time for that."
Yennefer, You can go later. We've more important things to do now.
Ciri, Yes. There are always more important things.
Yennefer, I'll talk to her. You're liable to spill.
Geralt, Let's look around. Should be a relatively fresh grave mound.
Ciri," Thank you for coming. I detest graveyards, especially wandering them"
Ciri, Glad you made it. I'd started to think you wouldn't find the time.
Geralt, You don't mean that. So...find the grave?
Ciri," No, I can't stand graveyards. Really dislike wandering them alone."
Geralt, Let's look around together. Come on.
Geralt," Graveyards, not my favorite either."
Ciri, Why not?
Geralt, Remind me of work. Never been to a cemetery to visit someone's grave.
Ciri," Ah, frankly, I'd rather have come here with a contract, to do some"
Ciri," Lasse, son of Njord... Olaf, son of Ove... Ynge, daughter of Trottnir..."
Geralt, They didn't burn it. Save that honor for kings and heroes. Doubt they
Ciri, Ugh. Bastards!
Geralt, What?
Ciri, Beyond the village -- there's a pit. They fill it with sheep taken by
Woman, What're you doin'?
Ciri, What you should've done long ago. We're burying Skjall.
Man," Buryin' Craven? You defy the writ of the elders. Begone, leave this place."
Geralt, Lower your voice. Before we need another grave.
Woman, How can you defend him?!
Geralt, We're not bound by them.
Woman," Aye, and you've clearly no respect for our customs, either."
Man, Craven's place is in the ditch.
Ciri, Ugh. Skjall saved your bloody lives! The Wild Hunt was after me. Had
Woman, What would the specters be wantin' of some lass who--
Ciri, I am not some lass. And anyone who so much as touches this grave will
Man," Aye, none will disturb it. Desecratin' graves -- well...it's the only"
Ciri, We were right to come. I was deeply troubled. You've no idea.
Geralt," Well, they shouldn't spit on his name anymore."
Ciri, Let's go.
Geralt, Back to the boat.
Ciri, Mhm.
Geralt, Go back alone. Need to tend to something.
Ciri, Very well. I'll see you.
Sentry, Geralt of Rivia?
Geralt, Know any other Geralts?
Sentry," Come with me, please. They've been expecting you."
h," ...You will position yourselves on the cliffs here, here, and--"
Yennefer, Thank you. I believe we know how to form a circle.
Philippa, Even those of us who lack eyes for the moment.
h," I simply wish to avoid-- Oh, Geralt. We were waiting for you."
Geralt, That's nice of you.
Geralt, Really? Seems to me you'd started already.
h, We were discussing questions of a magic nature. Nothing of great
Geralt, Right. 'Cause I'm just a simple witcher.
Yennefer, Don't worry. Simplicity has a charm all its own.
Yennefer," Simple, yet with so many complexes. Not now, Geralt."
Geralt, You were about to explain your plan.
h, It's simple...which does not mean it will be easy to execute. I
Geralt, Wow... Emhyr's being generous with his resources.
Fringilla, He's halted his entire Skellige campaign to help us.
Geralt," Not doing it just to be nice, believe me."
Yennefer, He's doing it for the same reason we all are.
Geralt, What about you? Where will you be?
h, Waiting in reserve. If something goes wrong...I shall react.
Geralt, Mm. Like a general commanding troops from a hilltop. Gonna signal us
h," Exquisite irony, but what did I do to deserve it? Have I given you"
Philippa," Ladies and gentlemen -- less talk, more action, please. Sisters, we"
Triss, Good luck.
Geralt, Plan's missing one important element -- what about Ciri?
h, Zireael will wait. At a safe distance from the Naglfar.
Geralt, Makes sense.
Ciri, Huh. I thought I could at least count on you to treat me seriously.
Geralt, Never treat you any other way. You know that. You can't defeat
Geralt, Wild guess -- not what you had in mind...
Ciri, No. I wanted to go with you -- that was my idea.
h, But I won't allow it. Far too great a risk.
Geralt," Well, can't say you're wrong there."
Ciri, Huh. I thought I could at least count on you to treat me seriously.
Geralt, Never treat you any other way. You know that. You can't defeat
Geralt, Don't have the right to order her around.
h," Amusing. Zireael said the same thing, only at a much higher"
h," Zireael, do you swear to stay on shore?"
Ciri, Do I have a choice?
h, Where are you going?
Ciri, For a walk? Or is that not allowed either? Because I could break my
h, Oh yes...the Elder Blood can be fiery.
Geralt, Gets that from her father.
h," I beg to differ... Emhyr is a pragmatist, Ciri an idealist."
Geralt, An idealist? What're you talking about?
h, Never mind.
Geralt, Telling Ciri she can't do something is counter-productive. Speaking
h, Let us hope.
Geralt, Pardon me?
h, Never mind.
Geralt, Didn't sound convinced.
h," No. But I can't very well tie her up and teleport her away, can I?"
Geralt, Hm. Definitely advise against trying that.
h," Time is short. If you wish to do something, brew your substances and"
Geralt, Triss? Everything all right?
Triss, Yes. I just wanted a moment to talk to you. Before...before it begins.
Geralt, Chin up... The Hunt's weakened. We've got--
Triss, No. No more about the battle. Just hold me. And say something nice.
Geralt, All this snow...it makes me think of Kovir.
Triss, And what do you think about?
Geralt, That it's like this all year there. Dark and cold. And you know what?
Triss, It won't?
Geralt," No. Because the days, yeah, days might be short, but the nights?"
Geralt," Hm. There's a lighthouse not far from here, you know."
Triss, Geralt! Are you suggesting we--?
Geralt," No...well, at least not right now. Just wanted to say... Wanted to"
Triss," Unbelievable! You said something romantic! You, Geralt of Rivia!"
Geralt, Moment of weakness.
Triss," Well, none of those during battle, please. If anything should happen to"
Geralt, Can't think about that.
Triss, So what am I supposed to think about?
Geralt, Emhyr var Emreis. On parade. Completely naked.
Geralt, I'll manage.
Triss, You always say that.
Geralt," Haven't killed me yet. Well, except for that one time."
Triss," Ah, Geralt. You're so charming when you try to be funny."
Geralt, Try? Take it back. That was a great joke.
Triss," Mhm. Sure. I love you, you know."
Geralt," You trying to make me cry? Ciri'd never let me forget it. Go on, get."
Geralt, Love you too.
Geralt, Yen? Why're you here?
Yennefer, To see you.
Geralt, Something happen?
Yennefer," Not yet. But it might soon. We may not survive this. In fact, our"
Geralt," We've come a long way, and I'll be damned if we've come to fail."
Yennefer, I admire your optimism. Wish I shared it.
Geralt," Well, we are here to battle Eredin and the Wild Hunt at full"
Yennefer, Nothing could be worse than Sodden was.
Geralt," Yen, try not to panic... Just doesn't suit you."
Yennefer, I'm not panicking. Just trying to be realistic. But that's not what
Yennefer," Listen to me. Once it's all over, if we survive... I wish to leave,"
Geralt, Where?
Yennefer," Wherever. To Poviss, beyond the Dragon Mountains, Zerrikania, even."
Geralt, I'd go anywhere with you.
Yennefer, The answer I was hoping for.
Geralt," I dunno, Yen. Honestly, sounds too beautiful to be possible, even."
Yennefer, You can always return -- if after a month we can't stomach each
Geralt, All right. Willing to try.
Yennefer, That's good enough for me.
Geralt, You? Dropping plots and politics for good? You're in your element in
Yennefer, Time to start anew.
Geralt," I'll believe it when I see it. Even now, you're up to your neck in"
Yennefer," Yes, but only to set matters straight, to be able to withdraw"
Geralt," What then? A small, secluded hut with a flower garden to tend to?"
Yennefer," Why not? If that is what you dream of? We shall leave together, go"
Yennefer," Go, Geralt, Avallac'h awaits. And don't get killed, witcher."
h," So, Geralt... Ready?"
Geralt, Let's get these bastards.
h," With pleasure, Geralt. With pleasure."
Geralt, Need a bit longer.
h," Fine, but don't dawdle excessively."
Ciri," ""I give you my heart?"" What kind of a spell is that?"
h," It's an old love letter. Ancient. As I said, this stone was to"
Ciri, Never thought I'd say anything of the sort to Eredin. (in Elvish) I give
Yennefer, The elven bauble worked.
h, They approach.
h," Break a sword, Geralt."
Soldier, (in Nilfgaardian) Ice! Reduce speed!
Geralt, Follow me. The Naglfar must be nearby.
Ciri, Silence. It's completely still.
h, It's a trap. We must flee. Now.
Ciri, Not this time.
h," No, Zireael. You are not ready. You do not control your powers."
Ciri, I'll manage. Get out of my way.
h," Ciri! The ice... It's a spell. You must find the mage who cast it,"
Ciri, I'll not stop with his staff.
Caranthir, Zireael. I await.
Caranthir," Almost, Zireael. Almost."
Caranthir, Ysgarthiad...
Caranthir, Witcher...? So be it. Let us end this.
Caranthir, You see? It's not so simple. I've more where that came from.
Caranthir, You cannot win...even if you kill me.
Caranthir, Er'chyl vatt'gern!
Caranthir, Gvialen!
Geralt, Ciri...
Udalryk, Now's our chance! Bjaaarni! You and your crew against the imperials!
Geralt, Have you seen Ciri?!
Udalryk, She was with your elf!
Udalryk, You'll not cut through their plate! Too thick! Push 'em in the sea!
Hjalmar, Who's next?! Who wants to taste Skellige steel!?
Geralt, Hjalmar! Have you seen Ciri?!
Hjalmar, By the Naglfar!
Hjalmar, We'll drown all you bastards! Till the bay's black with your corpses!
Soldier, Bloody hell! Which ones?! Who're we to shoot at?
Soldier, Whoever the fuck you have in your sights!
Soldier, We knew in settin' out -- there'd be no returnin'!
Soldier, We was to kill the Black Ones!
Soldier," Now we face the wraiths of Mörhogg! We'll die glorious deaths,"
Soldier," Waaaaaaagh! Outta my way, whoresons!"
Eredin, Any last words?
Crach, Shut your trap...and fight!
Eredin, You had your chance.
Eredin, Witcher. I was hoping you'd come.
Geralt, Because?
Eredin, I've something to tell you. But I'll do so afterwards. As you expire.
Eredin," Well, well... When cornered, you can bite."
Eredin, They trained you well at Kaer Morhen.
Eredin," I planned to kill Zireael quickly, painlessly... But now...I shall"
Geralt, Said you had something to tell me.
Eredin, Avallac'h has tricked us both. He set us against each other...and he's
Geralt, I don't believe you.
Geralt, Where's Ciri?
Yennefer, What? I thought you knew.
Geralt, All I know is Avallac'h might've betrayed us. What the--? That a storm?
Yennefer, Geralt... Look!
Geralt, Wha... What the hell's happening?!
Yennefer," I find it damned hard to believe, but... The gate between the worlds"
Geralt, Least we know where to look for Ciri.
Yennefer, Mhm. Follow me. And stay alert.
Geralt, What're we gonna find there?
Yennefer," If the tomes are to be believed, nature's laws will cease to hold."
Geralt," Exaggerating for effect, right?"
Yennefer, Not one bit. The Conjunction of Spheres has begun. The worlds --
Geralt, We need to focus on Ciri. What do you think Avallac'h wants from her?
Yennefer," Same as Eredin, I imagine. He will use her to open a gate between"
Geralt, Shit. An earthquake?
Yennefer, We must hurry.
Yennefer, Dammit... That ship's about to disintegrate!
Geralt, Hide in the hollow on the other side. Go!
Yennefer, Grab the horse! We'll save time!
Geralt, Giddy-up!
Geralt," ""And giants shall face giants in battle..."" Just like in the ballads."
Yennefer, This is not Ragh nar Roog...not yet. The Conjunction is just
Geralt, What'll happen next?
Yennefer," I don't know, Geralt. I'd rather not find out."
Geralt, Mhm... More on the way.
Yennefer," We must hurry, Geralt. The gates between the worlds are growing"
Geralt, Tremors're getting worse.
Yennefer, We've not much time.
Geralt, What happened to them?
Yennefer, The White Frost.
Geralt, Dammit... It'll bury us!
Yennefer," Wait! Gvares, tavel! Keep near me!"
Yennefer, Damn... Avallac'h's surrounded the tower with a magic barricade.
Geralt, Can you dismantle it?
Yennefer," Dismantle? No. I can make a tear, at best. But only for a moment,"
Geralt," Specifics, Yen. Will we both get through?"
Yennefer, No. You must go alone.
Geralt, I'll come back -- with Ciri.
Yennefer," I know. Agored, teirgane agored! Now, Geralt!"
Yennefer, I'm fine. Now go...and give Avallac'h my heartfelt regards.
h, Geralt... So unfortunate. I'd hoped you wouldn't have to witness
Geralt, Where's Ciri?
h, Nearby. Listen...
Geralt," Shut up. I've heard enough of your bullshit. Draw your weapon, let's"
Geralt," Think I'm gonna fall for that? No chance, you're wrong. Trusted you"
Geralt, Think I'm willing to spare you?
h, I think you will not attack one unarmed.
Geralt, Wouldn't be so sure. I'm in a foul mood.
h, I am not your foe. I am merely helping Cirilla.
Geralt, I don't believe you. Can't. Not after all that's happened.
Ciri, Will you believe me?
Ciri, Avallac'h speaks the truth. I asked him to help me open the tower --
Geralt," Didn't think it worthwhile to tell me, warn me of your plans?"
Ciri," I'm sorry. I know, I should have...but I feared you'd not understand."
Geralt, Ahhh... Feels like I'm talking to Yennefer. Leave with me. Please.
Ciri," I will, Geralt, once I emerge from the tower. If I emerge."
Geralt, Why the hell would you do this? The Wild Hunt's been defeated.
Ciri, The White Frost has not. The prophecies were true. I have seen worlds
Geralt," I couldn't care less about the White Frost. Let's just leave, go."
Ciri," No, Geralt. I've seen what is to come, I know destruction approaches."
Geralt, You don't have to make this sacrifice.
Ciri," You're wrong. The White Frost is inevitable, it will come to freeze the"
Geralt, Ithlinne's prophecy is drivel. Destruction is not our fate.
h," You have seen the future, don't you remember? Entropy cannot be"
Ciri," Avallac'h is right. If I do nothing, humans, elves, all will face"
Geralt, Avallac'h's muddled your mind with a fortuneteller's fables.
Ciri," You're wrong. The White Frost truly does approach. Worlds will freeze,"
Geralt, There's gotta be another way...
Ciri," What can you know about saving the world, silly? You're but a witcher."
Ciri, I'm sorry.
Geralt," Ciri, I forbid you."
Ciri, You know me. Nothing I like more than breaking rules.
Geralt, This? You're breaking more than a rule.
Ciri, I'm sorry.
Geralt, Don't do this...to me. Please. Not now.
Ciri," Geralt, believe me... A tavern, mulled wine, our boots drying by the"
Geralt," Good luck, Ciri."
Ciri, Perhaps I should have told you. I see now you might have understood.
Geralt, Know you better than you think. Don't keep me waiting.
Geralt, A werewolf...
Werewolf, Who are you?
Geralt, You know who I am. And why I'm here.
Werewolf," I do. You needn't... I'm no longer a threat. I starve, for the swamp"
Geralt, Crone summon you?
Werewolf," In my sleep...once I had wolf dreams. Now I dream hunger, pain, and"
Geralt, Where is she?
Werewolf, Out there...in the swamp.
Werewolf, Is there no other way?
Geralt, None. How many have you already killed? How many more might you
Werewolf, I don't know. Mostly I had no choice in the matter. 'Tis a foul
Geralt, That it is.
Werewolf, A last wish?
Geralt, No.
Geralt, Speak.
Werewolf, There's a wolf den nearby. Wolf cubs inside. Carry them out of
Geralt, Why?
Werewolf," They'll not survive here, or they'll change into something...evil."
Geralt, I'll try.
Geralt," There's one. Find the Crone, guide me through the swamp -- to her."
Werewolf, And then?
Geralt, Then I'll see.
Werewolf, Uh...
Werewolf," The Crone, what's she done to you?"
Geralt, Stole my daughter's medallion.
Werewolf, Heed my words. The Crone will fight like a wounded wolverine. She may
Geralt," No, it won't. My daughter's dead."
Geralt," Maybe, once, in a different time...I'd have helped."
Geralt," What's your name, werewolf?"
Berem, Berem.
Geralt," Lead me to the Crone, Berem."
Berem, There's a wolf den nearby. Wolf cubs inside. Carry them out of the
Geralt, How many?
Berem," Ten, no more."
Geralt, Stay out of it.
Geralt, What're you doin' here?
Hunter," A she-wolf's been on the hunt for the last few days. Killed a cow,"
Hunter," Stupid beast walked right into one, heheheh. Once she tires, we'll set"
Geralt, What happened to your ear?
Hunter, Why's it matter? None of your ploughing concern.
Geralt, Where's the Crone?
Hunter," Sod off, your kind's not welcome here. Leave our lands."
Geralt, Not just yet. Soon. First the Crone.
Hunter," You're one. We're ten, we've got hounds. Wanna end like the she-wolf?"
Hunter," Uhh... We'll flay you alive, you wretch!"
Geralt, Calm down. We don't need to fight.
Hunter, Just go. And the Lady of the Swamp -- you leave her be...
Geralt, Release the she-wolf.
Hunter, She's not weakened yet.
Hunter," She's ragin', knows she's as good as dead but has yet to accept it."
Geralt, Get outta here.
Hunter," What? You dim in the head? Beast killed our cattle, and she'll keep"
Geralt, My sentiments exactly.
Geralt," True enough. Hunter: Shove off, then! You're spoilin' our fun."
Geralt, See ya. Got something to do.
Berem, One cub lives...
Geralt," Come on, no time for that."
Berem, Won't survive on its own.
Geralt, Lead me to the Crone.
Berem, She's close. Somewhere here...
Geralt," Go back to your wolf dreams, Berem. Save the cub. Go away, far away."
Berem, Let me help you.
Geralt, No.
Berem, Remember -- like a wounded wolverine she'll fight. She could kill you.
Geralt, I know. Now go.
Weavess," Patience, sisters. I sense him, he comes. You shall yet have his"
Geralt, Come out!
Weavess, I sense your pain. I see your fear... Look about you! Feel their
Geralt, You lie. I don't feel a thing anymore.
Weavess," You've changed. You suffer. You seek death, I feel it. I know the"
Berem, I can't look at this... You must die...
Geralt, Stay out of it!
Mererid, The gentleman will follow. His Imperial Majesty awaits.
Emhyr, Speak.
Geralt, Ciri is dead.
Emhyr, How did it happen?
Geralt, The White Cold... You're familiar with the prophecy? Ciri tried to
Emhyr, Where is the body?
Geralt, I doubt it'll ever be found.
Emhyr, Who else knows?
Geralt," Avallac'h, elven Sage... But I doubt you'll find him, either."
Emhyr, And Yennefer?
Geralt, She's decided to stay in the North. Provided you don't object.
Emhyr, I don't. And you?
Geralt," Plenty of work for witchers after a war. I'll travel east, maybe"
Geralt, That's none of your business. Not anymore.
Emhyr, Hmmm.
Emhyr, Did Cirilla say... Did she ask you to convey anything?
Geralt, She regretted not getting a chance to say goodbye.
Emhyr," Did she tell you this, really?"
Geralt," Didn't have to. She wanted to make peace, I know that."
Geralt, You weren't a good father. Ciri saw you as a threat. Even if she'd
Emhyr, Understood.
Geralt, We didn't talk about you.
Emhyr, I see.
Geralt, If there's nothing else...
Emhyr, There is. But you may go.
Emhyr, Witcher. I do not wish to see you. Ever again.
Geralt, Need a hand with your wagon?
Man, Err...no.
Man," It's not exactly ours, more a captured vehicle. Booty, you might say."
Man," Folk must've abandoned it in their rush -- to where, I don't know. Be a"
Geralt, Change is coming.
Man," Grown accustomed, we have."
Man," With the Black Ones gone, witch hunters'll move in. Yet life'll roll on."
Man," True, that! So let's get to work afore the night creeps up on us!"
Geralt, Sure you don't need any help?
Man, I believe we'll manage.
Geralt, Time I was on my way. Good luck to you.
Man," Where you headed? Nearest inn, by the looks of it."
Geralt, Yeah. Supposed to meet someone first -- at the former campsite of the
Geralt, Master Ort! Hmm... Probably got held back.
Geralt, You're late.
Ort, Soldiers...
Geralt," ...blocking the roads, I know. No matter. You have it?"
Ort, As agreed.
Ort, Thirty-eight and a half inch blade. Weight -- just under 40 ounces.
Geralt, Beautiful.
Ort, Been in this trade for three decades. Only the best swordsmen have the
Geralt," Reputation precedes you, Master Ort. I'd never doubt you."
Ort," The inscription, as you asked..."
Geralt," ""Zireael."" Swallow."
Geralt," ""Dubhenn haern am glâdeal, morc'h am fhean aiesin."""
Ort," ""The flash that cuts through darkness, the light that breaks the night."""
Geralt, Exactly.
Ort," Classic Elder Speech runes. No styling, simple and precise."
Geralt, May I?
Ort, It is yours. If you'd like to test it -- had my lacqueys put out a
Geralt," Mhm. Your payment -- gems only, as requested."
Ort," If you've an eye out for work, heard a striga's prowling the Maribor"
Geralt," Thanks. Need to visit the tavern first, but after...who knows?"
Ort," Good luck on the Path, witcher."
Ciri, Is it done?
Geralt, Yes.
Ciri, Did he believe you?
Geralt, I have no idea.
Ciri," For the cockatrice. And we've a new contract. It won't pay much, but I"
Geralt, You've been busy.
Geralt, It's yours.
Ciri, A witcher's silver sword...
Geralt, Like it?
Ciri, It's beautiful. May I?
Ciri, Swallow. Ooooo. Beautiful. May I?
Geralt," Not here. You'll have ample opportunity soon enough, witcher."
Ciri, What's this inscription?
Geralt, An old witcher's motto. Had a sword like this once myself. But this
Ciri," Let's try it out, then."
Zoltan, I might believe you if you showed me a pair of monogrammed batiste
Dandelion, More likely you'd just say I stole them.
Zoltan, Heheheh.
Geralt, Dimwits.
Triss, Were'nt you supposed to be somewhere?
Geralt, Yeah. Alright.
Yennefer, You were supposed to be somewhere.
Geralt, I was. Fine.
Yennefer, Where will you meet?
Geralt, Near the huntsman's cottage.
Triss, Where'd you agree to meet?
Geralt, By the huntsman's cottage.
Dandelion, Old man always had a soft spot for me. He could sense I was a family
Zoltan, What's the name again? Count Julian Alphonzo de what?
Dandelion, Viscount Julian Alfred Pankratz de Lettenhove.
Zoltan, Hahahaha!
Dandelion, Don't believe me? Just watch -- you'll wipe that doubting leer off
Zoltan, Hahahaha! You just invent this count bit? Quite the imagination for one
Dandelion, Geralt'll vouch for me. Tell him -- I've always said I'm a count.
Geralt, True. You have always said so.
Zoltan," Just nobody's bothered to verify it, hahahah."
Geralt, What's with this count business all of a sudden?
Dandelion," Well, when we leave this gods-forsaken dung hole, I plan to reclaim"
Geralt, I'm going rabbit hunting. Dandelion?
Dandelion, Glad to have some rabbit stew. But freezing my ass off to amass
Zoltan," Aye, fields're covered with rosemary bloomin' like wild just before"
Dandelion, That's why I'll be gathering my herbs from the kitchen.
Geralt," Eh, so long."
Geralt, Got plans for all these lands and titles?
Dandelion," I'll take possession of them. 'Course, there's also the issue of"
Zoltan, Is that so? Mean you finally found a lassie worthy of the great
Dandelion," My dear friend and companion, why, my heart belongs to the one and"
Zoltan," Your heart might, true...but the rest of your anatomy..."
Dandelion, I resent the insinuation! And hasten to remind you that you are
Geralt, No need for the count to get riled. Rather you told us how your
Dandelion," Recovered, mostly. Even started singing again. Her voice is a"
Geralt, What're friends for...? Give her my best.
Dandelion," Don't worry, I will. Give her a kiss, even -- a bit from you,"
Geralt, Gotten cold.
Man," Out on a hunt, master witcher? Thought you'd cleared the area of beasts"
Geralt, Rabbit hunting this time around.
Man," Aah, so that's it. Maybe you'd come 'round, visit us this eventide?"
Geralt," Hm, don't know if..."
Man, As you will. You're always welcome.
Mislav, She's gone.
Geralt, Mad she had to wait?
Mislav," No, eager to roam the fields. Prepared the cover scents and oiled the"
Geralt," Make a good hunter, wouldn't she?"
Mislav," Nah. Too impatient, that one. Probably snatchin' rabbits barehanded,"
Geralt, Where'd she go?
Mislav, Not far. Over yonder.
Geralt, Farewell.
Geralt, Not up to hunting rabbits anymore?
Ciri, Tsk. Not really.
Geralt, What now?
Ciri," Nothing. Just sitting, waiting for you. It's nice here."
Geralt," Ah, wait till you see Dol Blathanna in winter. And the Blue Mountains."
Ciri, You promised to show me that griffin's nest before we left. Let's go now.
Geralt, We should pick up the snares.
Ciri, Mislav will collect them. And we should probably try to hunt along the
Geralt, You actually interested?
Ciri, Absolutely. You said it yourself -- a royal griffin's a rare sight.
Geralt, Not that rare. Venture to say we'll have to slay a couple more before
Ciri, Come!
Geralt, Just this morning the rabbits were a matter of life and death.
Ciri," To be honest, I just wanted to go for a walk with you."
Geralt," Let's go, then. Nest is just up the hill. Griffin's carcass might still"
Ciri," Mmm, splendid!"
Geralt, We were supposed to train today.
Ciri, Uh-huh.
Geralt," Tomorrow at sunup, then? Work you hard like I did in the good old days."
Ciri, Mhm.
Geralt, Ahem. Almost there.
Geralt, Careful now.
Ciri, This is no time for you to lecture me.
Geralt," Ciri, wait. There's something in the--"
Ciri, We really don't need to play hare and hounds.
Geralt, Ciri!
Ciri, What?
Geralt, A hair faster -- that's all it needed to be to rip your shoulder wide
Ciri, But it wasn't and it didn't. We killed it. What is this about?
Geralt," You're angry, wanted to unload. But be that careless, and next time--"
Ciri, Don't you understand?! There won't be a next time!
Geralt, Ciri? What are you talking about?
Ciri," I'm sorry, it's just...it's not a good time."
Geralt, Wanna head back? All right. Enough. Let's go fishing.
Geralt," We bring Dandelion a nice, fat perch, and he just might forget about"
Ciri, Mhm.
Geralt, Shame he didn't come along. He could use a bit of exertion.
Ciri, Mhm.
Geralt, Ice shouldn't be too thick here.
Ciri, Uh-huh. How exactly do you plan to catch anything?
Geralt," Heh, you'll see."
Geralt, I'll be damned...
Ciri, Should we go?
Geralt," No, no way. Lake's gotta be full of perch, bream, or pollard. Mmm..."
Ciri," I wouldn't mind some, but...do we plan to wait until he leaves?"
Geralt," No, we'll scare him off."
Ciri, How?
Geralt, I'll improvise. Wait here.
Geralt," An old witchers' trick for tough winters. Not terribly subtle, but..."
Ciri, Effective.
Geralt," Mhm. Remember, don't ever do this."
Ciri," Why show it to me at all, then?"
Geralt," Just in case. Never know what could happen on the Path, what could"
Geralt, All right. Let's go.
Ciri, Who taught you that?
Geralt, Vesemir. A long time ago.
Ciri, How long?
Geralt, Very. Back when I wanted to call myself Geralt Roger Eric du
Ciri, What? Hahahah.
Geralt, Tell you about it tonight.
Ciri," And about the time you broke your leg, after wagering you'd jump off the"
Geralt," Hm, how do you even know about that?"
Ciri, Eskel told me. But I want to hear you tell it. I'm certain you have a
Ciri," You never gave me piggyback rides at Kaer Morhen, remember? Vesemir was"
Geralt, Ugh! Had to wait till now to remind me? You've put on some weight since
Geralt, Ciri?
Ciri, We should get back. Remember me training on the pendulum? How I feared
Geralt, How could I forget?
Ciri, Those months at Kaer Morhen -- they passed so quickly. I wish we'd spent
Ciri," Almost managed to forget it was today. They're here for me, Geralt. I'm"
Geralt, Is this what you want?
Ciri, Yes. You'll not try to stop me? Take me to the Blue Mountains by force?
Geralt," Traveled half the world to find you, but I never intended to force"
Ciri, I know.
Geralt," You could've told me, warned me."
Ciri," I wanted to, but...I didn't know how. I've been happy here. I was"
Geralt," So, back at the nest -- that was about this. I didn't pry, didn't"
Geralt, You make this choice on your own?
Ciri," If you mean to suggest Yennefer had anything to do with this, then the"
Geralt, Great. She even know?
Ciri, No. And I'd prefer she not get involved this time.
Geralt, I'll let you tell her that.
Geralt," You'll be fine, you're a witcher."
Ciri, We needn't say goodbye.
Geralt, Course we don't.
Ciri, I don't know when we'll see each other again.
Geralt, You know where to find me.
Ciri, You can't possibly stay at Kaer Morhen all the time.
Geralt, Makes no difference. You'll find me.
Ciri, True.
Geralt," Remember what I taught you. Never know -- could be useful there,"
Geralt, Yeah we do.
Ciri, You could come with me.
Geralt," No, Ciri. That's not me, you know that."
Ciri," I know, but...I thought--"
Geralt, You've made your decision. And I made mine long ago. War's over. I'll
Ciri, When do you leave?
Geralt, Now.
Ciri, Won't you at least give Triss some time to pack? So this is...
Ciri, So this is...
strategists," Radovid V,"
Keira, We're certain to find something here.
Keira," How about that, you changed your mind."
Geralt, Miss me?
Keira, Hardly. Now focus.
Keira, Looks like another damned riddle to me.
Geralt, Inscription here.
Keira, Show me!
Geralt," Can you translate the inscription? I can decipher maybe a third, but"
Keira, Give me a minute... I was never any good at the high variant of the
Geralt, Just -- translate it to make sense.
Keira," ""Four guardians, four flames, standing proud in a line. The First to"
Geralt, Hm... Sounds like a riddle all right.
Geralt, All right. Let's see if we can't solve this.
Geralt, Mind repeating the riddle?
Keira, Lit up like a charm.
Keira," Um, seems we did something wrong."
Keira, Wait. Something just happened.
Geralt," Mhm. Behind that wall, a movement."
Keira, It worked! Oooh!
Geralt, Looks like some elven sanctuary...
Keira," Whose grave is it -- what do you think? No inscription, sadly."
Geralt," Hm... Sign of the gull. If I didn't already know where she was buried,"
Keira, Perhaps it's a monument to her?
Geralt, Can't see the elves commemorating her this way. Heroine of a tragic
Keira, Perhaps the elven mage is Lara's kin. It would explain why he's helping
Geralt, Possible. This what you're looking for?
Geralt, So what's it supposed to do?
Keira," Hm, I hope I'll be able to activate it... Let's leave this place, shall"
Geralt, We going?
Keira, Mhm.
Keira," Whew, at last. But it was worth it, right? You learned something about"
Geralt, Don't know that I'll get the chance.
Keira," Geralt, there are two types of men: those who see opportunity and take"
Geralt, I'll stop by. You can be sure.
Geralt, I'll try.
Keira," In that case, I shall be waiting."
Geralt," See you, Keira."
Keira, The rats -- why did he need them?
Man," Bloody rodents, better to have stuffed them with a poison or crushed them"
Keira, Did you see what he did with them?
Geralt, Keira? What are you doing?
Keira, Geralt! You gave me quite a start!
Man," ...but nay, the mage says, ""Bring me the rats! An' healthy ones! Not"
Geralt, This the lamp from the elf's hideout? And what's this about rats?
Keira," Nothing important, I'll explain later. Now tell me -- to what do I owe"
options," ""Find the lamp?"" and ""Hope you're not mad at me..."". The"
Geralt, Keira.
Keira, What are you doing here?
Man," ...but nay, the mage says, ""Bring me the rats! An' healthy ones! Not"
Geralt, What's this? What's he saying about rats?
Keira, It's no concern of yours.
Geralt, Manage to find the lamp?
Keira, Yes. And you? Come to ask my help again?
Geralt, No. But if there's anything I could do for you...
Keira, Hmm...
Geralt, So there is something.
Keira," Hmm...indeed, I do have a small favor to ask of you."
Geralt, Hope you're not mad at me.
Keira," Oh, of course not. I understand perfectly well that you had"
Geralt, Why'd you want the lamp?
Keira, You just witnessed why. To communicate with lost souls.
Geralt, Didn't know you were interested in that kind of magic.
Keira, There's nothing wrong with it.
Geralt, Mhm. Why'd the elf promise you the lamp?
Keira, We traded for it. He needed powerful magic and sensed I was no
Geralt, Who'd he want to use it on?
Keira, He didn't say...
Geralt, Mentioned you wanted something from me.
Keira, I did. And still do. The cursed isle on Lake Wyndamer -- you've
Geralt," I managed to. But while on the island, I did sense"
Geralt, How'd it come to be cursed?
Keira," That's what I don't know! I must break this spell, yet I've been"
Geralt, Gotta know something...
Keira," Scraps. The curse is somehow linked to the tower where Vserad,"
Keira," So, will you please help me lift this curse? You're so good at these"
Geralt, All right. I'll help.
Keira," I knew you'd find it irresistable! Naturally, you'll need to"
Geralt, Fine. What then?
Keira," Well, the spirits who wander the isle -- you must establish a"
Geralt, Think they'll be willing to chat?
Keira," Of course, provided you take my magic lamp with you. I shall let"
Geralt," How's the lamp actually work? I mean, do I just rub it or do"
Keira, You needn't even rub. Just place it where you find bones and
Geralt," Figured as much. Tell you all about it later, maybe skip the"
Keira, You'll need to do neither. I'll give you a xenovox. It's a
Geralt, I need to know anything else before I go?
Keira," No. That is all. Oh, go already. I can't wait to see what you"
Geralt, Hm?
Keira, Thank you.
Geralt, Never heard of a xenovox.
Keira," It works just like a megascope, but is far more portable."
Geralt, They hard to build?
Keira, Extremely. That's why they're so rare. I certainly couldn't
Geralt," So, no chance these xenovoxes'll catch on, with every mage"
Keira, Not the slightest.
Geralt," So, where'd you get the xenovox?"
Keira," Found it in the mine, along with the lamp. Thought it was part"
Geralt, Think it belonged to the elven mage?
Keira, Clearly. And I didn't even know the elves used them.
Geralt, Can't you just come with me?
Keira," I tried to go to Fyke Isle once. Thought my head would burst,"
Geralt, Nice of you to send me there.
Keira, I experienced an acute nasal hemorrhage. You stand to endure
Geralt," Funny, thought you'd go in for that sort of thing."
Keira," Take my boat. I left it on the lake shore, near the village."
Geralt, Why're you so intent on this?
Keira," I'm not, the local peasantry is. ""The isle, miss! You've got to"
Geralt," Uh-huh. See, I thought you didn't care for the locals. The"
Keira, I fail to lift the curse and they could conclude I'm not so
Geralt," What others think, your image -- that's all you care about."
Keira," The point is... Listen, I didn't flee to these wilds just to"
Geralt, So the peasants who went to the island for food -- this lord
Keira, The villagers say he had them poisoned.
Geralt, A real gentleman.
Keira," Hm... I never met him, but he didn't seem such a cruel man"
Geralt, A mage lived on the island? Did you know him? Where is he now?
Keira," We were friends. Sadly, he died that day as well. Very few"
Geralt, Need to think about it.
Keira," Not too long, I trust. If you've any questions--"
Geralt, ...I'll know where to find you.
Keira, Ughh...
Keira, Geralt? Can you hear me? How goes it? Where are you?
Geralt, Almost there!
Keira, Splendid. I shall contact you again too.
Geralt," Wait! This xenovox -- can I contact you with it, or is it one way¹?"
Keira," One way¹ only, I'm afraid. You'll have to trust my feminine intuition."
Geralt, Your what?
Keira, My feminine intuition!
Geralt, Wonderful.
Keira, Geralt? Are you on the isle yet? Does the xenovox work? Can you hear me?
Geralt," What? I can't hear... Great, broke already. Sheesh. Short-lived, this"
Keira, What did you say? There's some interference... You must be very careful.
Geralt, Let's try Keira's lamp.
Ghost, They're onto us... They'll not let Graham in.
Ghost," Quiet, fool! Babble on and the noble himself will hear ye."
Ghost," Nah...He's sat his arse on silk pillows. Likely be gobblin' meat, heheh!"
Ghost, ...with no notion we's comin' to tear him to shreds!
Ghost," Way's clear, lads! At 'em!"
Ghost, They left us! Look! All of 'em done went!
Ghost, We've to swim. Come on.
Ghost, What about all this? I can't leave it! You go. Find a boat and come
Ghost, Hah! Why wouldn't I? Be back before you know it.
Geralt, Wonder what lead them here. Hunger...or greed?
Ghost," Millie, we gotta flee! Quick now! Millie? Millie, what's with ye?"
Ghost, I dunno... So hot...burnin' -- agh!
Ghost," What? No, no, stay back!"
Ghost, Don't...leave me!
Ghost," Where's that noble? Lyin' here, quiet as a mouse, head split open like"
Ghost," Too quick a death,¹ they gave him. Shoulda been made to suffer!"
Ghost, He's not the end of it. Sons can suffer for 'im...and the daughter! To
Keira," Geralt, stop! You needn't be so detailed."
Ghost," Rich folk, doubt I'll ever understand 'em. Keepin' rats in cages -- like"
Ghost," Let 'em out, maybe...? Like to die of hunger if we leave 'em there."
Ghost, I'd sooner burn the vermin. Releasing 'em's not like to bring no good.
Ghost, Swam? Rats? How d'ye figure they'd do that?
Ghost, Ye needn't fret for 'em. Clever little bastards. Cleverer'n you.
Ghost," Hm, they seem sluggish to you? Got the mange, maybe? Oargh! And that"
Vserad," Don't start, Anabelle! Back to your crafts! Always bending my ear about"
Alexander," My lord! Peasants! They're through the door, in the tower!"
Ghost," Gooold! Piles of it! Won't do the dead any good now, will it? Strange"
Keira, Where are you? Have you got to the laboratory at the top of the tower
Geralt, I'm at the top. Nothing here that looks like a laboratory.
Keira, Then you've not reached the highest level. Look for a passage.
Geralt," Hm, looks like a laboratory. Pretty well equipped, too."
Geralt, Kept in there until the end. What a shitty way to die.
Ghost, Why did you leave? You claimed to loved me. I'm cold... Why has no one
Ghost, Who are you? Do you seek to hurt me as well?
Geralt, I'm a witcher.
Geralt, Don't be afraid.
Geralt, I wanna lift the curse that grips this island. Your turn to tell me
Anabelle, I'm special. Always was. The rare beauty. The lord's daughter. These
Geralt, Tell me what happened here. Peasants sailed to the island to
Anabelle," No, they came to rob and kill! They thought us rich,"
Geralt," What kind of potion was it? Remember its smell, what it"
Anabelle, I remember only that I feared to drink it.
Geralt, What happened then?
Anabelle," Fear, terrible fear. I feared the men who approached, but"
Geralt, Mage who lived here -- who was he?
Anabelle, Alexander. I hardly knew him. He spent most of his time
Geralt," If I can lift the curse, you yourself'll be free to leave."
Geralt, Didn't trust the mage?
Anabelle," In the village, they claimed he meddled in disease. Not curing it,"
Geralt, Did they hurt you?
Anabelle," They gripped my arms, tore at my dress... I managed to"
Geralt, Poisoned? That how you died?
Anabelle," No, for I later awoke. I was alone, it was dark. Only"
Geralt, Sleeping potion. Effects hadn't worn off yet. You were
Anabelle," They were everywhere, all over me, like insects. My"
Geralt, How can I help you?
Anabelle, A curse born of hatred binds me to this place. Only
Geralt," And your beloved -- he dead, too?"
Anabelle," Graham... No, he lives. I would know if he died. But he"
Geralt, Maybe you could strip the curse of its power by forgiving
Geralt," As I see it, you're the curse's focus. The other ghosts"
Anabelle," I don't know what you mean, but you do seem to know some"
Geralt," It could be your blood ties to the land, the base of the"
Geralt, Your beloved -- who is he? A noble's son?
Anabelle," No, a poor fisherman. My father objected. Strongly. He"
Geralt," Hm, said before you can't leave the tower."
Anabelle, Did I? You must have misheard.
Geralt, I don't think so.
Anabelle, I...I don't know anymore. It's all a nightmare to me...
Geralt, You weren't the last to die on this island. Found a fresh
Anabelle, The island's a dangerous place. Folk should not venture
Geralt, The dead man -- looked like a monster attacked him.
Anabelle, How am I to know? There's lots of wraiths here. I hear
Geralt, Not talking about ghosts. A monster who hunts here. You
Anabelle, I don't know! I've noticed naught -- why do you ask?!
Geralt, Can you talk to the island's other specters?
Anabelle," No, I'm alone here. The others, they flee when they see"
Geralt," No. Used to dealing with ghosts. Though...gotta admit,"
Geralt, Your beloved failed to save you. Why?
Anabelle," There were too many... ""Leave her be!"" he shouted. He"
Anabelle, I...loved him. I'm prepared to forgive him. But I must know he
Geralt," Fine, I'll talk to Graham. Where will I find him?"
Anabelle, He lives in the village on the lakeshore... Yet...what if
Geralt," If he loved you, he'll remember. And wanna help."
Anabelle," He said he would always love me... Go to him. Make haste,"
Geralt," Really sad story, but something's not right. Got a"
Anabelle, What is it?
Geralt, You're not telling me everything. You know the island's
Anabelle, There is no monster!
Geralt, I think you're lying. Question is: why? To protect the
Anabelle, Stop! I will not hear this!
Geralt," I can't help you. Taking anything off this cursed island,"
Anabelle, They said witchers are heartless beasts. Will you bring
Geralt," Anabelle, listen--"
Anabelle, You never wished to help me! And here I hoped someone
Geralt, Really hope I can help. Need to look around first.
Anabelle, Whatever for? Naught in the tower but bones and rats.
Geralt, I'll come back for you. You can be sure.
Anabelle, Very well. But...come back soon. Don't keep me waiting.
Peasant, Why you been followin' me?
Geralt, Just wondering what you want from him. From Graham.
Peasant, Me? Didn't want nothin'. It's his mother be worried 'bout him... Been
Geralt, I wanna talk.
Graham," You deaf, dammit? I told ye-- Who are ye?"
Geralt, I'm a witcher.
Graham, What of it? Why should I care?
Geralt, I've been to the island. I know what happened there.
Geralt, I've been to the island. I know what happened there.
Graham, What d'you want of me?
Geralt, Wanna talk to you about Anabelle.
Graham, Anabelle. What can you know about her?
Geralt," I met her, talked to her..."
Graham, Anabelle's dead. Drank poison. And I...couldn't save her.
Geralt, What happened on Fyke Isle? You gotta tell me.
Graham," Twere¹ Millie, Finch and Faulkner -- they rallied the men,"
Geralt, They force you to go with them?
Graham," No, I...I saw my chance in it. For Anabelle and me to flee."
Geralt, It wasn't poison. Anabelle took a strong sleeping potion.
Graham, But...that means... Is she...? You said you spoke to her.
Geralt," Spoke to her ghost. By the time she awoke, tower was full of"
Graham, You mean...she was alive the whole time? But...can't be! She
Geralt, Anabelle needs you. You can help her.
Graham, But...what can I do? It's too late...
Geralt, Bury her bones. Anabelle should be laid to rest by one who
Graham, Those are...her bones?
Geralt, Yes.
Graham, Give 'em here. And leave me be.
Geralt, It's not your fault. No guilt in not knowing -- and you
Graham," Gods, what 'ave I done! If I'd stayed behind to bury her..."
Geralt," If you'd stayed on the island, I doubt you'd have survived."
Graham, I'd take death over leavin' her to the rats like that! But
Geralt, Wrong on that count.
Geralt," Said you were hollering as you fled the tower, the island."
Graham, I...don't remember. I wanted them to pay -- for what they'd
Geralt, Might've cursed them. There's a powerful magic aura on Fyke
Graham," She took the poison, because of them."
Geralt, Did you love her?
Graham," Aye, somethin' mad. Loved her so deeply I believed we'd come"
Geralt, Dead... Anabelle was no ordinary ghost. She's a pesta. And now she's
Geralt, Dammit... Gotta catch them!
Pesta, You cannot kill me. You know this...
Keira, What was that? It sounded for a moment like you'd joined the wraiths
Geralt, Had to fight a pesta.
Keira, A pesta? And did you learn how to lift the curse before you lunged at
Geralt," Yeah, we talked a bit. Looks like I need to get her beloved to the"
Keira," I know the man. Lives in Oreton, village on the lakeshore. Find him"
Peasant, Why you been followin' me?
Geralt, Just wondering what you want from him. From Graham.
Peasant, Me? Didn't want nothin'. It's his mother be worried 'bout him... Been
Geralt, I wanna talk.
Graham," You deaf, dammit? I told ye-- Who are ye?"
Geralt, I'm a witcher.

Geralt, Anabelle needs you. You can help her.
Graham, Is she still there...in the tower? Can I...see her?
Geralt," Yeah. One thing you should know, though. In death, Anabelle"
Graham," A ""pester""? What's that?"
Geralt," More than a restless ghost. A plague maiden, a powerful"
Graham, She suffers... How am I to help her? Gods know I'm willin'.
Geralt, A curse has imprisoned Anabelle and the other spirits on
Graham, Just as in the legends...
Geralt," If you know the legends, you know one kiss is enough to"
Graham," I told you, I love her with all my heart! Take me to her,"
Geralt," It's dangerous, there are risks involved. Understand that,"
Geralt, Nothing. Let's go.
Graham, I'm ready.
Geralt, Nothing. Meet you by the tower on Fyke Isle.
Graham, Good. I'll await you there.
Geralt, Anabelle thinks you abandoned her.
Graham," Gods! She...hates me! And all this time, she thought I ran,"
Geralt," Yes. Go to the tower, talk to her. Maybe you can convince"
Graham, I thought she'd died...I'd never have left her there
Geralt, It's not your fault. No guilt in not knowing -- and you

Graham," Aye, somethin' mad. Loved her so deeply I believed we'd come"
Geralt, Let's go to the tower.
Ghost, You! We wander this place because of you!
Ghost, I've waited long enough for revenge! And now he comes to us on his own!
Graham," No! No, run! We gotta go! They'll kill me!"
Geralt, Don't be afraid. You'll be fine.
Graham, Last I came through here I still hoped Anabelle and I would... It
Geralt," Can't change the past, but you can still help Anabelle, to move on, to"
Graham, It's terrifyin' here... It's too quiet.
Geralt," Chop, chop. Speed up. Let's get this over with."
Graham," I remember the screams. Inhuman, they were. Now it's silent. They're"
Geralt, Don't think about that. Keep walking.
Anabelle, You have not forgotten. You've returned for me.
Graham, I-is-is th-that...?
Anabelle," Don't you recognize me? It's me, Anabelle, the one you abandoned,"
Graham," Anabelle, I--I was sure ye were dead. If I'd known otherwise, I'd a"
Anabelle, Prove it. Kiss me.
Geralt," Graham, careful..."
Anabelle, At last.
Geralt, The curse is lifted. And Graham and Anabelle're reunited.
Geralt, Fyke Isle's free of its curse.
Keira, And you withheld this news until now? Why? I gave you a xenovox! But
Geralt," The dark spirit clung to the spirit of Anabelle, the lord's daughter."
Keira, So it ended well.
Geralt," Hm, I lifted the curse, so the island's clear. Anabelle's soul is free."
Keira," And you failed to notice? You're losing your touch. Be that as it may,"
Geralt, Fyke Isle's free of its curse.
Keira, Able to persuade Graham to go to the tower with you? Did you mention
Geralt," He knew the risks, but he'd also heard lots of stories about true love,"
Keira, And? It ended well?
Geralt," Depends how you look at it. Curse is lifted, Anabelle's spirit has left"
Keira," Oh, poor boy. Still, he's proved that true love may be more common than"
Geralt, The lamp -- what do you wanna do with it?
Keira," As I said, you may keep it. I don't believe I shall need it"
Geralt, One thing's bothering me...
Keira, What?
Geralt, Anabelle said Alexander was studying diseases. She mentioned
Keira, All the mages knew about it. Alexander was a highly regarded
Geralt, All right. Time I was on my way.
Keira, Perhaps...perhaps you'd stay just a bit longer? There's one
Geralt, What is it?
Keira, I put in an order for a few substances from Novigrad. The trader
Geralt," Why not. If he was coming here from Novigrad, he must've"
Keira, Thank you. I shall be ever so grateful.
Geralt," Got it all wrong, Keira. I'm not your errand boy."
Keira," Oh, you're definitely no boy. You're a strong, poised witcher"
Geralt," Can't promise you anything, but I'll let you know if I run"
Keira, That is all I ask.
Geralt, Yeah... Merchant traveling across Velen alone... No way that was gonna
Geralt," Package still intact. Don't sense anything magic, though... Wonder how"
Geralt," Got those, uh, substances you wanted."
Keira, Splendid. I can finally begin my study of double arboreal racination
Geralt, Brew yourself a mug of mulled wine? Saw what the wagon was carrying.
Keira, I would rather show you. But you must wait a bit.
Geralt," Color me intrigued. Fine, I'll wait."
Keira, Then shoo -- outside!
Geralt, Gotta slip into something more comfortable?
Keira," Later... Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Well, go on -- out."
Geralt, Maybe another time...
Keira, I don't like men who turn me down.
Geralt, And I don't like surprises. Especially ones sorceresses spring on me.
Keira," I daresay this one, once sprung, would thrill you... Ah well, change"
Keira, You've been patient -- thank you. It's almost ready...
Geralt," Huh? If I wanted to see white mice, I'd just get drunk."
Keira," Note that I said ""almost."" Now don't interrupt. Byc'hane, gyvn, caeffyl!"
Geralt, Third mouse -- what happened to it?
Keira, The spell has a sixty-six point six seven percent chance of success...
Geralt," So where'd it-- Keira, gonna explain what's going on here?"
Geralt, Changed mice into horses -- third level transfiguration. I'm
Keira, Know the fairytale about Cinderella?
Geralt," Mhm. True story it's based on, too. A zeugl cropped up in a palace"
Keira," I beg you, not another word about zeugls. Now, to return to the"
Geralt, Sounds tempting. So tempting I don't think I can refuse.
Geralt," I'm a witcher, not a gigolo."
Keira," Don't flatter yourself. I don't want to shag you in the bushes, but to"
Geralt," Ooh, all right. I'll do it."
Keira," I feel honored, truly."
Geralt," You're gonna have to conjure up your prince, too. Heard frogs are"
Keira, You heard wrong. It's princes who get turned into frogs... It could
Keira, Before we go...there's one more thing.
Geralt, Gotta transform a pumpkin into a carriage?
Keira, No. I shall transform our rancid rags into something more glamorous.
Geralt, Why not. Might as well go all out.
Keira," Then hold on tight. Gvella, glan!"
Keira," So, what do you think? Neckline too modest?"
Geralt, It's just right.
Keira, I might also have changed your hair color while I was at it... I've
Geralt," No way. Don't like having spells cast on me... Besides, my clothes"
Keira, Debatable... But let's not argue and ruin the mood.
Keira," Well, off we go. Dinner's waiting... Last one there does the dishes!"
Keira, Eeee-yah!
Geralt," Whoa, Cinderella! Or you'll have a great fall!"
Keira, As fast as you can! Try to catch me!
Keira, Congratulations. You'd make an excellent jockey.
Geralt, If only I were a foot shorter and five stone lighter.
Keira," Well, yes...but then I'd not have invited you here."
Keira, I thought you a better horseman.
Geralt," For the record, I was riding a mouse."
Keira," For someone who usually trots around on a Roach, that shouldn't"
Keira, Now do you see why I needed those...substances?
Geralt," Beef in cinnamon and cloves, roasted capon with shallots... It was"
Keira, Shall I pour the wine or the--?
Geralt, Dry red. But let it breathe a little first.
Geralt, Could've just told me what this was about right o--
Keira," Ugh. ""Geralt, run into the woods and fetch my shopping. I'd like to"
Geralt, If I'd known I'd get a glass of Zubarran dry in return? Of course.
Keira," Well, well... Never took you for a wine connoisseur."
Geralt, Think witchers suck the marrow out of drowner bones and wash it down
Keira," More or less. Well, we've chatted long enough on empty stomachs. Let's"
Geralt, Must've cost you a small fortune. Sure you don't need me to pitch in?
Keira," Please, I manage. You know, a dozen eggs here, a cock or gander there..."
Geralt," How -- if you don't mind me asking? I mean, you'd think the only work"
Keira," Hah. Very true. So, I've two options. I can either start cultivating"
Geralt," All right, I'm curious. We celebrating something?"
Keira, Yes. A return to the living.
Keira," But that's not what I wished to discuss. Thank you once again, Geralt,"
Geralt, Not the first curse I've lifted.
Keira," But among the most difficult, correct? What happened on that island..."
Geralt," Didn't destroy the workshop, if that's what you're asking. Didn't"
Keira, If Alexander's findings were to fall into the wrong hands...
Geralt," Ugh, why are you even interested?"
Keira, Because I grasp the importance of the studies conducted there. In the
Geralt," All right, let's get down to business."
Keira, What are you talking about?
Geralt," Sex. That's why we're here, isn't it¹?"
Keira, Ah! You may know about wine...but you remain quite unsophisticated
Keira," Ugh, I'm sorry. Such a gloomy subject to broach... I simply shouldn't"
Geralt, Romantic? Thought we came here as friends.
Keira, Friends...with benefits. So?
Geralt," Your fairytale, your rules."
Keira," Really? Then, close your eyes...and count to ten."
Geralt, Sorry. Just not in the mood.
Keira, Is it a headache? Or does the problem lie elsewhere in your anatomy?
Geralt, Sorry... There's someone else.
Keira," So what? Oh, Geralt, Geralt. You're so old-fashioned."
Keira, Will you at least lie down and gaze at the stars with me?
Geralt, Hmm... Why not.
Geralt," One... Two... Three... Four... All right, that's enough."
Geralt, Keira...? Wanna play hide-and-seek? Why not.
Keira, Found me. Congratulations.
Geralt, Do I get a prize?
Keira," I've nothing on me, but I'll think of something."
Keira, Know what they call that constellation in Zerrikania?
Geralt," Dragon something, I bet."
Keira," No, it has a different name... A bit indecent, actually. Lean closer and"
Geralt, Keira? Where...? Put me to sleep with a spell. Means she's up to
Geralt, Fyke Isle. The tower.
Geralt, A light... Top floor of the tower.
Geralt, So. Found what you were looking for?
Keira," Yes, thanks for asking. How are you feeling? Sleep well?"
Geralt, What do you want with those papers?
Keira," Why, I am to use them to continue important work that a man's tragic"
Geralt, You used me.
Keira," Oh, please... I merely seized an opportunity."
Geralt," If I'd known you just wanted Alexander's notes, I'd have never helped"
Keira," All right, perhaps I wasn't completely honest, didn't quite toe the"
Geralt," I don't... You're a vile, two-faced, four-tongued viper."
Keira," Aha! Ho, ho... And I always took you for a gentleman."
Geralt, All jokes aside -- what're you gonna do with those notes?
Keira, Do you really believe you can call me names and then revert to polite
Geralt, I'll go as soon as you hand me those notes.
Keira, Then you shall stay here forever...
Geralt, All right. Don't have time to argue with you. Do what you will.
Keira, I need neither your permission nor your blessing. Get out.
Geralt, Didn't come here to play games. I wanna know what you're up to.
Keira," Naturally, you suspect me of the worst. I don't deserve that. My"
Keira, Alexander was studying the Catriona plague. I'll use his notes to
Geralt," Mhm. Strictly humanitarian motivations, is that it?"
Keira, No. Strictly selfish ones. The mighty would pay willingly for such a
Geralt, You're either incredibly gullible...or you're trying to play me
Keira, Whatever do you mean?
Geralt," Radovid has one objective -- to defeat Emhyr. Curing Catriona,"
Keira, Don't be ridiculous. Bacteria cannot be controlled.
Geralt," Not yet... But it's possible in theory, isn't it?"
Keira, In theory it's just as possible for a dachshund to impregnate a
Geralt," Radovid doesn't forget, and Radovid certainly doesn't forgive."
Keira, He'll make an exception for me. He'll have to. I have something he
Geralt," Please, you don't believe that."
Keira," Well, you believe Yennefer will stop treating you like a dog someday."
Geralt," Keira, I can't -- I won't let you do this. Thousands of lives in"
Keira, I'll not give you these notes. I'll not give you anything.
Geralt, Please... Don't make me...
Keira, Shut up and draw your sword.
Geralt," This is suicide, Keira. You'll wind up tied to a stake, burned to"
Geralt," It's your conscience, but you do know hundreds...thousands could die."
Keira, What of it? What difference will it make if Nilfgaard's legions die

Geralt, So you're fine assisting in genocide? That doesn't strike you as

Keira, Shove your sarcasm up your arse.
Geralt, Right on that count -- I don't like this. But it's your life. Gonna

Keira," Shut up for a moment and look at me. See this? Bedbugs, Geralt. Bloody"
Geralt, Got another option. Go to Kaer Morhen.
Keira, You believe I'd be safe there?
Geralt," No. The opposite. When I get there with Ciri, I expect we'll have to"
Keira, Unbelievable! Have you even been listening to me?
Geralt, Closer than you think. You're not looking for safety. You want your

Geralt," So, see you at Kaer Morhen? Beds free of bedbugs...mostly."
Keira," I long to be there already... See you, Geralt."
Geralt," Yeah, kinda... So before I go, I'll need you to hand me those notes."
Keira," All right, all right. Take them already. Farewell, Geralt. Or rather,"
Geralt," Expect me to pity you...? Because of some bedbugs? You're joking,"
Keira, They... They truly did leave you heartless. Get out of my sight.
Geralt, I'm not one to judge... Whatever you think is right.
Keira," Farewell, Geralt of Rivia. I hope... I truly hope you find your Ciri."
Geralt, Didn't have to end this way...

Geralt, Agreed.
Baron, I'll gather my men!
Geralt, Gotta prepare.
Baron," Prepare, now? Will you shine your boots and trim your nails? Argh, do"
Geralt, Meet you at the Crones' village.
Baron, Fall in! We've a swamp to cross and those cursed Crones to hunt down.
Baron, Ploughin' swamp! Pox-ridden air promotes brain-rot in the peasants.
Geralt, The Crones exist. You'll know that soon enough.
Baron," Hah, right. More likely some mad old wenches making mincemeat of peasant"
Geralt, Mhm.
Guard," Oof, hard fight, tough goin'."
Guard," Aye, haven't seen that many all at once in a while."

Graden," I don't know you, but-- Arghh! I thank you!"
Geralt, Introductions later!
Graden, Witcher? Why are you here?
Geralt, Tell you later!
Tamara, Who're you?
Geralt," Geralt of Rivia, witcher."
Tamara, We could use your kind if you'd find the heart to serve the Eternal
Geralt, Heard quite a lot about you.
Tamara, Witcher? Change your mind? How much did my father pay you?
Geralt, Don't think you have anything to fear. Brought your new friends with
Tamara, I have no fear for the Eternal Fire protects me.
Geralt," Mm, won't need to protect you from me."
Baron," Tamara, dear daughter! You return after all! Come, don't deny me this"
Tamara," Stay away from me. I've come for mother. Unlike you, I'll not see her"
Baron, Why the hell do you think I'm here? To take her home.
Tamara," Oh, you'll do no such thing. You'll not lay a finger on her. Never."
Baron," You've a right to be cross... I was not the best husband, the best"
Geralt," Your father -- he wants to find his wife, your mother. Really."
Tamara, He pay you much to be his yes-man?
Geralt, Your business. I refuse to meddle.
Tamara, Rightly so.
Geralt, Stop arguing. It's stupid. We need to find Anna.
Graden," ""Verily I say unto you that ire and vehemence can lead to naught but"
Baron, Who the bloody hell is this?
Graden, And who are you to ask so crudely?
Tamara, This is my commander.
Graden, And that should be of no concern to a drunken swine.
Baron, Tamara! You stand with their kind now? Perhaps you'd have them torture
Tamara, You're not my father. And I care not a bit what befalls you.
Graden, A-hem. I remind you we've a matter to resolve here.
Geralt, Wouldn't be here if I wasn't willing.
Graden, I've lost five men and have little notion of what else to expect in
Geralt, No time to lose. Crones could return any minute.
Graden, Hah. How do you know they're not here already?
Geralt, Cause¹ we're still alive.
Graden, Search the village!
Tamara, Don't!
Hunter, Over here!
Anna," Scrubbed it good. Oy! Get back, stinky-head, gingerbread loaf, freshly"
Tamara, Mother...
Anna," Ah, there, clean as a whistle...fresh as a daisy... Go on, whip me, I"
Tamara," Oh, mother..."
Anna, Take pity.
Anna, But I pleaded... I begged...
Tamara," Mother, it's me. Do you recognize me? Wha--what's happened to her?"
Anna," I said I'd do it all. Give it 'ere, I'll scrub it again. Scrub it clean."
Tamara, Mother!
Geralt, Something's coming. Get ready.
Tamara, What was that?
Baron, Wolves...perhaps?
Graden, Didn't sound like wolves.
Geralt, Because it wasn't. Get ready.
Brewess," We'll cut you up, boy. A fine broth you'll make."
Whispess, You reek of fear. You'll spoil our feast.
Weavess," Mmm...the muscle, the sinews, the fat...deliciousss... Sluuurp."
Baron, What was that?
Graden, Looked a fiend to me.
Geralt," Crones've sensed us, they know we're close. Sent the beast for Anna."
Tamara, Those damned witches! When will it end?! Look what they've done to her!
Baron, She's my wife. She'll return home with me. You're welcome to come with
Tamara, Don't touch her! We leave this cursed place now.
Baron," She's sick, weakened... Where would you take her in this state?"
Tamara, I know how to care for my mother!
Graden, She's not a rag doll to be ripped from hand to hand! Let her decide!
Anna, Pie! Pie for dinner! Mud pie!
Geralt, She's incapable of deciding anything just now.
Tamara," A dark spell, it must be. Help her, witcher. I beg you."
Geralt," This is no dark spell, I'm afraid."
Tamara," Well, what is it then?"
Geralt," She's been through a lot. Lost a child, was carried off by a fiend,"
Tamara, So it's hopeless? You can't help her? She's to be like this?
Geralt, I'm sorry.
Baron," I know a hermit, a very wise man with a gift for healing. Met him some"
Geralt, Might be worth a shot.
Geralt, It's no use. Doubt a healer can do anything for her now. Doubt

Graden," That's impossible, sadly."
Tamara, Why?
Graden," You have duties, duties deriving from your commitment to the Church"
Tamara, You said you'd save my mother!
Graden, And I kept my word. Your father can care for her now.
Tamara," He, care? You know him! You know what he did to her!"
Graden," He swears to be a changed man. And in his eyes I see true sorrow,"
Baron," Fear not, all will be well. I will not touch drink. I will find the"
Tamara, Swear it.
Baron," You have my word, child."
Geralt, Witchers were made to kill monsters. It doesn't matter who posted the
Tamara, Thank you witcher. Despite all.
Graden, May the Eternal Fire guide and protect you.
Geralt, Farewell.
Graden, You were right to let your father take her.
Tamara, I'm not so sure.
Graden," We could do nothing more. Nor could the witcher. If she can be helped,"
Tamara, Perhaps you're right...
Sergeant," Ah, witcher! Greetin's! Baron's not here. Rode off to find a healer."
Geralt, I know. Seen what's happening outside the gates?
Sergeant, What do you mean? Baron left me in command. Told the boys to set
Baron, They're murdering and pillaging.
Sergeant, That is the new order. And I don't give a flyin' fuck if you like it
Hunter, Over here!
Hag, Hssss... Hssss...
Tamara, M-m-m...
Tamara, Mother?
Anna, Oooo! Aaargh!
Tamara, Huh! Is--Is that her? No-- Noo... Impossible -- we must do something!
Anna, Aaaaaarrrgghhh!
Geralt, Something's coming. Get ready.
Tamara, What was that?
Baron, Wolves...perhaps?
Graden, Didn't sound like wolves.
Geralt, Because it wasn't. Get ready.
Brewess," We'll cut you up, boy. A fine broth you'll make."
Whispess, You reek of fear. You'll spoil our feast.

Baron, What was that?
Graden, Looked a fiend to me.
Geralt," Crones've sensed us, they know we're close. Sent the beast for Anna."
Tamara, Those damned witches! When will it end?! Look what they've done to her!
Geralt," Last I was here, she was nothing like this. Crones must've cursed"
Graden, Can you lift this curse?
Geralt, Not till I know what it is.
Tamara," She can't have lived here alone. Perhaps there's someone else,"
Geralt, Maybe Johnny...
Graden, Who?
Geralt, Err...a boy. A hermit. Lives in the swamp. Came around here from time
Graden, We must find him.
Geralt, Doesn't like strangers. You wait here. I'm better off going alone.
Geralt, Easy. Shouting won't help. Calm down.
Tamara," Simple for you to say! How can I?! That's my mother, understand?!"
Graden," He's on our side. Let him think. Witcher, do you know what's wrong"
Geralt," Johnny! Joohnnny! Not here. Something's not right. Gotta look around,"
Geralt," Johnny, wake up."
Johnny," What? Who? Oh, witcher. You frightened me. Thought it were those vile"
Geralt, Killed a few near your den.
Johnny, The Crones sent them. To punish me.
Geralt, So you saw what happened to Gran?
Johnny," By happenstance, Gran mixed some poppy seed and ash. Went by to help"
Geralt, Stay in the chest until the Crones left?
Johnny," Wanted to. ""Sit tight and quiet,"" said to meself. ""Not a peep out"
Geralt, So? You give her the herbs?
Johnny, Couldn't manage it -- the Crones came back. I dropped to my knees
Geralt, There's something in that cellar. The key to finding out what
Johnny, Will you help her?
Geralt," Provided it's not too late. Thanks, Johnny. And good luck to you."
Johnny," Likewise. And if you happen on any water hags, give 'em a nice,"
Geralt, You escaped. Consider yourself lucky.
Johnny," I do. But I've not lost the Ladies for long. If I'm to live, I must"
Geralt," Try deeper in the swamp, maybe?"
Johnny, Argh. I suppose I must. And what will you do?
Geralt, Take a look under the door?
Johnny, I look like a fool to you?
Geralt," No. You do look like the inquisitive type, though."
Johnny, My inquisitiveness ends where folly begins.
Geralt, Why'd the Weavess need Gran's hair? Any idea?
Johnny, The Crones take folks' ears to hear all. Hair gives 'em power over
Geralt, Get on the Crones' bad side?
Johnny," I told 'em off, and they don't like it when you tell 'em off."
Geralt, Why'd you do it?
Johnny, Wanted to help Gran. She's always been good to the children. Would've
Tamara, Did you learn anything?
Geralt, Just as I thought -- the Crones probably cursed your mother. Took a
Graden," In that case, we've no time to lose. Come."
Geralt, I work alone.
Graden, This matter concerns us all.
Geralt," We don't know what's in there. Your men'll make a lot of noise, more"
Graden, I am the Church of the Eternal Fire's agent in these lands. It is my
Geralt," Fine... Just you, then. The rest stay here with Anna."
Geralt, Lemme go in first. Give you a shout if I find anything interesting.
Graden, So be it. Let's begin.
Geralt, Graden!
Graden, By the Eternal Fire... I've never seen so many before.
Geralt, Looks unsavory. What is all this?
Graden, The trappings of a black magic ritual. Witches weave human hair through
Geralt, Think one of the dolls represents Anna? Can we free her if we find it?
Graden," It's the only way I know of, but there are risks involved. The items"
Geralt, This risk you mentioned -- take it we only get one shot at choosing
Graden, I'll not chance it. I did not know Anna... You've learned much of
Geralt, All right. Let's take a look at these dolls.
Geralt, Seem to know a lot about this.
Graden," From tomes on black magic. Initially, we burned any that we found."
Geralt," Poisoning your minds with magic, heh, superstition? What's the"
Graden, Have you met the man?
Geralt, No.
Graden, Neither have I.
Geralt," Hm, red bead attached to this one. Anna wears a string of those around"
Graden, As do half the women from Novigrad to Vengerberg. This cannot be the
Geralt, And I think it is. I'm taking this doll.
Geralt," Hm, all right. I'll look at the others."
Geralt," Hm, bird feathers woven into this one... If I had to bet on it, I'd"
Graden," Phillipa Eilhart? If that's true, then--"
Geralt," Relax, first name came to mind, that's all. Phillipa's way too clever"
Graden," That might seem obvious...but what if it's a ruse, and this doll, in"
Geralt," Could be true... Fine, I'm taking this one. Sure as hell hope you're"
Graden, As do I.
Geralt, Doubtful. Crones'd have no reason to employ trickery here. Should
Geralt, Hm...this is interesting.
Graden, A doll with a flower? What's so interesting in that?
Geralt, Not just any flower -- a violet hollyhock. Baron once told me it was
Graden, Hm. You believe this to be the doll?
Geralt, I'm sure it is. Taking it.
Geralt," Might very well be, but I can't be sure. Should look at the others."
Geralt, Human ear attached to this one.
Graden," Belonged to one of the peasants, doubtless. Anna still has both her"
Geralt, Let's look at the others.
Graden, Quick! Outside!
Tamara," Mum, you're back! All will be well, you're going to be fine."
Anna, Tammy... I'm dying...
Baron," She's not well, ravin'... Doesn't rightly know what's happenin'..."
Anna," No, listen to me... The Crones... I was to be their beast in the end,"
Tamara," Wh-What's she talking about, witcher?!"
Geralt, Hmm... The Crones deceived us. Their curse is a death sentence. No
Tamara, What?! What does that mean?!
Baron, She's dying.
Geralt, Nothing we can do to help her.
Baron, But we... No! That's impossible!
Anna, Dear daughter... Phillip...
Anna, It's good...to see you together...
Baron," I'm sorry, Annie. For everything... I'm sorry."
Tamara, Mother...
Anna, Tammy... Do you remember? That day on the Ina...?
Tamara," Of course. Those plums were so sweet, your dress so blue... You wove me"
Anna, Please... Remember me like that.
Tamara, Noooo!
Graden, I thank you. They had a chance to say goodbye. That was your doing.
Geralt, Shame I couldn't do more.
Graden," Come, child. The Eternal Fire will soothe your pain."
Baron, Leave me be. Your pay will await you at Crow Perch. Collect it there.
Graden, It's Anna! What have you done?!
Tamara," What have you done? You were to save her! She burst into flames, hear"
Geralt, This was a cursed place. Anna herself was cursed. This is the best
Tamara, You bastard!
Geralt, I'm sorry. Didn't know it would end this way.
Tamara, You're sorry? You're sorry?!
Tamara, And you! Will you just stand there?! You hired this murderer! Have you
Graden, Come. Let us go. This might've been done differently. We could have
Baron, Come to Crow Perch for your pay.
Graden, None of this was your doing.
Tamara, I know... Which makes it no easier to bear.
Graden, The pain will pass in time.
Tamara," I'd like to believe that, I would."
Graden, You may have a moment with her... Then we must bury her and return to
Tamara, Very well.
Graden," We must give her a moment, let her collect her wits. Once she has"
Guard," Yes, sir."
Geralt, What the hell happened?
Sergeant, Hanged himself. Plain enough to see.
Geralt, Was he drunk?
Baron, Yeah... Always knew the hooch'd be his end.
Geralt," Himself, or did you boys help him?"
Baron," What the fuck do you take me for, a murderer? He was what he was, a"
Geralt," If I'm to choose between a greater and lesser evil, I'd rather not"
Sergeant, Lost everythin' he cared for. No surprise he lost the will to live.
Geralt," Don't look too concerned, you and your boys."
Sergeant, What would you have us do -- sit and wail? Baron was a good soldier.
Geralt, I imagine they will.
Man, Yes? Who you 'ere for?
Geralt, Triss.
Woman," Told 'er from the start -- no men, no pets! 'Tis a decent house, for"
Geralt," Don't worry, won't stay long."
Triss," Geralt, I've got a problem. Can we talk?"
Geralt, Been in Novigrad long?
Triss, Long enough to know how not to get caught...and survive.
Geralt," And before you came here, where were you?"
Triss," Oh, places...where I managed to get by without your help, too. Which"
Geralt, See you kept the rose of remembrance I gave you in Flotsam.
Triss, Seems so long ago... Probably because so much has changed.
Geralt," So, sentimental value...that why you kept it?"
Triss, Partly. Though...more as a warning.
Geralt, Feel all right?
Triss, Hm. So-so. Why do you ask?
Geralt," Been wondering -- how's your hand, your fingers?"
Triss," They'll heal. Listen, it was my idea. I knew exactly what I was"
Geralt, Hm... Maybe we should talk about something else.
Triss, Gladly. I was about to ask the same.
Geralt," So long, Triss."
Geralt, What did you wanna talk about?
Triss, I got a strange message. I don't quite know what to think.
Geralt, Who was it from?
Triss, Ingrid Vegelbud's servant. Apparently Lady Vegelbud's prepared to donate
Geralt, Guessing this wouldn't be a selfless act of charity.
Triss," You guess right -- and that's my problem. Vegelbud needs a favor, from"
Geralt, Don't like this at all... But you seem determined -- not about to let
Triss, Thank you.
Geralt, The servant -- how're you supposed to contact him?
Triss," Said I'd recognize him -- he'll be in a blue tunic, have a load of"
Geralt, Gotta be kidding me... He tell you to come holding a red rose?
Triss," He doesn't mention flowers, but I won't refuse if you feel like"
Geralt," It's a fish market, Triss. Be able to get you some salted cod at"
Geralt, Whose idea you think this was -- the servant's or Vegelbud's?
Triss, My bet's on Ingrid. High-born damsels have a lot more time than their
Geralt, I don't think you should contact this man.
Triss, I'd like at least to check... My guess is this could be about a mage
Geralt," Seems suspicious, and you just had a close scrape. Sure it's not time"
Triss, And let the hunters grab the mages who remain here? Out of the
Geralt," Triss, this is foolish. They catch you, and you won't be there to"
Triss," I'd hoped to go with you. If you change your mind, come and see me."
Geralt, I'll think about it.
Geralt," What're you afraid of, exactly?"
Triss," That it's a trap. On the one hand, it's an opportunity I can't afford"
Geralt, Nobody expects you to risk your life.
Triss," I expect that of myself. The thing is, it used to be easier. When I"
Geralt, You could've escaped at any time.
Triss, I know! But I was still terrified! What if they fetter me in real
Geralt, Think it'll be better if I talk to mystery man in the blue tunic.
Triss, He's expecting to meet me.
Geralt, You just wait nearby. I'll make sure that note didn't come from the
Triss," Mhm, fine. Let's meet there."
Geralt, Lots of blue jerkins. Interesting.
Man, Yeah?
Geralt, Know where I can get the best price on trout?
Man," Perhaps... But it wasn't you I was to meet, sir."
Geralt," Wanna talk to the letter's recipient, I gotta be present."
Man, Caution would advise--
Geralt, Caution's advising you not to argue right now. Trust me.
Man, Seems I've got no choice. Come with me.
Geralt, So long.
Man, This way! It's not far.
Bandit, That's im! Get 'im!
Man, Thank you... Let's go.
Geralt, What'd they want from you?
Man," I've no clue! First time I've laid eyes on 'em. Maybe...well, recently"
Man," You were to come alone, miss!"
Geralt," If not for him, that trio would've dragged you in for questioning. The"
Man," Aye, you're surely right, miss. I...it just weren't what I expected, since"
Geralt, So what's this about? Be straight.
Man, Lady Vegelbud's son -- he's the...problem. Master Albert's taken an
Geralt," Now that we're past the initial courtesies, maybe you can tell us"
Man," Lady Vegelbud's valet. I...I meant you no offense, sir."
Triss, Why wouldn't Lady Vegelbud meet with me personally?
Man, She was afraid they'd follow her. Been a nervous wreck of late.
Triss," Wouldn't worry about the Guard, but since the mage hunters tried to"
Man," Aye, Lady Vegelbud bought off the guardsmen, but since the hunters pay"
Geralt," Guardsman took a bribe from the frightened family, then whispered"
Geralt, Seems Albert needs to disappear -- soon as possible.
Triss, I can arrange that. Think young Vegelbud can slip out of the house
Man," 'Tain't that simple, sadly. Master Albert's in hiding -- at the"
Geralt, How'd Ingrid Vegelbud know to contact Triss? That Triss was the
Man, We learned Miss Merigold had helped Myra Baiss disappear once the witch
Triss, Makes sense. Myra mentioned treating a high-born lady to me once.
Triss," Am I supposed to attend, help him escape?"
Man," Aye, we'll not manage without you, miss. Lady Vegelbud fears the help's"
Geralt," It's a good idea. A boisterous bash, that'll distract the hunters."
Triss, Especially if even half of what I've heard about the Vegelbuds' balls
Geralt," If the hunters are after Albert, I doubt some merrymaking will"
Triss," Geralt, a ball at the Vegelbuds' is hardly some merrymaking..."
Triss," Word is at the last one they served a hundred different desserts, and"
Man," What with the war and all, m'lady's ordained but eighty-five desserts this"
Triss," Oh, I'd love to see it all..."
Geralt, Hope we won't have to stay till the end.
Triss, You're coming with me?
Geralt, Course I am. Not about to send you into what could prove to be the
Geralt, Expect any trouble during the ball?
Man, Hardest part'll be to keep Master Albert's departure a secret from his
Triss, Is that necessary?
Man, Lady Patricia's a fervent believer of the Eternal Fire. Knows naught
Geralt, Truly an atypical family...
Man," I'm not one to judge, sir."
Triss," Geralt, please... How do we get to the residence?"
Man, Your invitation -- take it. Guard at the gate'll have instructions for
Geralt, Think we can head there now?
Triss," You're kidding, right? We have to prepare, change clothes...most"
Geralt, Something I need to do first.
Triss," Fine, buy our masks while you're at it. And you should change -- ball"
Triss, I bet you can get everything you need for the ball at Elihal's shop.
Geralt," Been there before. Elihal's a friend of Dandelion's. Just masks, right?"
Triss," A doublet, Geralt. And it's not up for discussion. Take care of that,"
Triss," Oh my, certainly took my request to heart."
Geralt, Mean you weren't being serious? Still got time to change...
Triss, Don't you dare. You look great.
Triss, Geralt!
Geralt, Someone's in a good mood.
Triss, So?
Geralt," Nothing. Just, you look good when you're giddy."
Triss, You get everything?
Geralt," Everything's ready, we can go."
Triss, A shame events like this are so rare. Without them I'd never get to
Geralt, Argh. Damn doublet's chafing my armpits. And it feels like they
Triss, I'll be sure to admire your valiant suffering the whole time.
Triss, Just a shame you didn't dress up like I asked.
Geralt," Really expected me to show up in a lacework collar, ruffles on my"
Triss, You'd even look great wearing a bustle.
Geralt," Doubt I wanna know what that is. For now, you'll just have to"
Triss," Well, then -- shall we go?"
Geralt, Learn anything else about Albert?
Triss," Well, almost none of the mages have heard of him. An amateur, I guess."
Geralt," So why the interest -- temple guards first, then hunters?"
Triss, He's easy prey. And that's exactly why we should help him.
Triss, Come back once you've got it all.
Sentry," Greetings, m'lord, m'lady."
Geralt, We're Lady Ingrid Vegelbud's guests.
Sentry," Your invitation, please."
Sentry, All's in order. You'll find Lady Vegelbud in the estate's yard. Look
Geralt," Must be some mistake. You know why we're here, don't you?"
Sentry, Of course. But I've orders to make certain every guest enters the
Geralt, Dammit...
Geralt, Fine.
Sentry, A pleasant evening to you both.
Triss, It's beautiful here! I haven't been outside the city in ages!
Patron," Hello, Vivian! No use pretending you don't know me! Is that any way to"
Triss," There's been a mistake. I don't know you, sir."
Patron," Don't be foolish, Vivian... I'd recognize that mane anywhere. You might"
Geralt, Enough. The lady says she doesn't know you.
Patron," Who's this? The new one? Older than the last, it seems. A decrepit"
Geralt, You asked for it...
Geralt," Let's go, Triss. Wouldn't want to make a scene."
Patron," Vivian! Hey! Ah, I liked you much better when you worked the"
Triss, What a jackass.
Triss, We weren't supposed to draw any attention
Geralt, What? Nothing happened.
Patron, Mercy... I've had enough.
Triss, Moritz? What're you doing here?
Moritz," Little Miss Merigold, well, well. And I was led to believe this would"
Triss," Yes, I missed you, too. But can we put that aside for now? Do you have"
Geralt, Triss! Not what we're here for.
Triss," No, it's exactly why we're here. Well, Moritz?"
Moritz, Join you? And just who would I join?
Triss," Your friends, among others. Once we've all gathered, I'll lead you--"
Moritz," You will lead? Forgive me, Merigold, but that is like allowing myself"
Geralt, Who was that?
Geralt, Didn't like that guy. Why'd you insist on talking to him?
Triss, He's an old friend. His name's Moritz Diefenthel. Tell you the story
Triss, Oh! Let's look around.
Guest," Then I said, ""Perhaps you should not remove your mask."" And she said..."
Ingrid," Mhm, mhm."
Guest," Are you listening to me, Ingrid?"
Ingrid, Excuse me a moment.
Ingrid, Miss...?
Triss," Yes, it's me. The trout buyer."
Ingrid," Hm? Oh, yes, of course. Please excuse the precautions, but...perhaps we"
Ingrid, Thank you for agreeing to help. My valet warned me you might come with
Triss, Like no one else.
Geralt, Let's get Albert. Where is he?
Ingrid, Entertaining the guests. He has always been an outsized presence at
Triss, When can we take him away?
Ingrid, We shall have to wait until the guests have imbibed enough to notice
Geralt, How will we recognize him?
Ingrid, He's donned a panther mask. He knew you were due to come for him.
Geralt, Don't worry about that. He'll fit in with a good number of the other
Triss, Geralt! Let's go find him.
Ingrid, I shall await word from you.
Geralt, Is your son ready to go? We'll have to act quickly.
Ingrid," Yes, I've seen to everything. Where will you take him?"
Triss," You're better off not knowing any details. He'll be safe, I promise."
Ingrid, But...
Triss, Please trust me. It's not my first time I've done this.
Ingrid, I know. Thank you.
Geralt, Any sign of the hunters recently?
Ingrid, Since they attacked my servant at the market -- none. All has been
Triss, How did the guardsmen learn about your son's interests to begin with?
Ingrid," Ahh, unfortunately, I cannot be sure Albert himself was not the"
Geralt, Yyyeah... Must've traveled far and wide.
Ingrid, Hardly. He attempted to breed them. Perhaps I should be pleased
Triss, Let's look for Albert.
Albert," ...and then, a colossal boom!"
Woman, Oh!
Woman, And? And?
Albert," Nothing. I leapt out of the way in time, naturally, and it merely"
Woman, Oh my!
Albert, One needs the agility and reflexes of a panther. Wrrroar!
Albert, Yes?
Geralt, Albert Vegelbud?
Albert," No, heheheh..."
Woman, Heeheehee.
Albert, I'm a black panther! Rrraw!
Woman," Oh, my. Count!"
Geralt," Your mom sent us, Mr. Panther."
Geralt, Your excursion to Novigrad -- we should talk about it.
Albert," Oh, so you are..."
Geralt, Nice mask.
Albert, Rrraw!
Woman, Heeheehee!
Triss, Yes. When can we leave the estate?
Albert, Weeeell... Mama said it would be best to wait until everyone's drunk.
Geralt, Be waiting for you there.
Albert," Very well, but first you must absolutely try the Fiorano rosé."
Geralt, Hope Albert hasn't forgotten the reason for this whole get-together.
Triss, Wanna wait in the garden? I saw a nice spot there earlier.
Triss," Care to sit down for a spell? Relieved to get that mask off, if only"
Geralt," So, does this mean it's a good time to ask you about..."
Triss, Yes?
Geralt, About that mage we met earlier.
Triss," Ah, Moritz. What do you want to know?"
Geralt, Got the impression he doesn't exactly like you.
Triss," I just think he'd love to have me as his charge, rather than his"
Geralt," See, but you're the one organizing the mages' escape from Novigrad."
Geralt, How'd you meet?
Triss," Geralt, all mages know each other. Some are well over a century old --"
Geralt, In that case: when did you meet him?
Triss," At a feast, long go. He walked up and...just blatantly offered to"
Geralt, You turn him down?
Triss, Is that what you think?
Geralt, Seems just like the type.
Triss," Really. At the time, he seemed to me...sweet."
Triss, Sometimes I have no idea how I actually managed to bring them all
Geralt, You're a charismatic leader. Simple as that.
Triss, You really think so?
Geralt, Absolutely. Next thing you know they'll be calling you Iron
Triss, Hahah. For a moment there I thought you were being sincere.
Geralt, Course I'm being sincere. Look at me -- didn't blush a bit.
Triss, Hahahah.
Geralt, Personal charm -- that's what it's about.
Triss, Hahaha. Careful -- that sounded like a compliment.
Geralt, Glad it did.
Triss, Oh. Are you trying to...?
Geralt, Didn't mean it to. Don't quite know why I always say stuff around
Triss, Always? Guess I remember things a little differently...
Geralt, They don't have anyone else.
Triss," Sheesh. Thanks, Geralt. If you meant to say something nice, try"
Geralt," I'm glad we came here, together."
Triss," Really? Despite all these bloated nobles, the bowing, the fake"
Geralt, Mhm. Not often we get the chance to just talk.
Triss, Something you've been meaning to say to me?
Geralt," Your eyes, they're like stars."
Triss, Hmmm... Geraaalt...
Geralt," Really, they're incredibly shiny. Could be the wine. You better not"
Triss," You're terrible, you know that?"
Geralt," Uh, you look nice."
Triss," Pfff, a witcher's compliments..."
Geralt, Someone's coming.
Triss, Is it Albert?
Geralt," No, just some lost guest. Shh!"
Triss, Heeheehee. Must be looking for his beloved. Like in that elven tale
Geralt, Sshhhh! Let's go.
Triss, Hahahha. I sure hope the other guests don't get drunk as quickly as I
Geralt," Sooner we get out of here, the better."
Triss," Oh, no! I plan to have a good look at this famous maze of theirs"
Geralt, Entirely what?
Triss," Nude! Come on, Geralt!"
Geralt," Triss, wait!"
Triss, Geeeralt! Coming?
Triss, Hahaha! Waaaoho! Hahaha...
Geralt, Careful...!
Albert, Miss Merigold! At last! So sorry we were forced to meet under such
Geralt, You could say that again.
Albert, ...but I'm sure we'll make up for it another time. I absolutely must
Triss, Anyone follow you?
Albert, I don't believe so.
Triss," Just in case, you two switch masks."
Triss, We'll go first. Geralt will follow right after.
Albert, Saddled horses await in the stables.
Geralt, Good. Meet you there.
Woman, Albert! Why do you hide? Albert! You promised to show me your
Geralt, Under any other circumstances I'd give you the full monty.
Woman," Oh. I'm sorry, I..."
Hunter, Albert Vegelbud?
Hunter," Please step away, miss."
Hunter," Nobility's naught to us, young count. Try anything and you will get"
Geralt," Hmm, doubt it."
Ingrid, I had begun to worry.
Geralt, Everything's fine. Though you should probably send someone to...clean
Ingrid, I'm to send servants to the garden?
Geralt, Yes.
Geralt, Ran into some trouble.
Ingrid, Hunters? Will they come here?
Geralt, No. We've got some time. But please someone to the garden. Needs a
Ingrid, I shall see to it. And you must hurry.
Geralt, Everything set?
Triss, Yes. Got your swords back from the guard. And Ingrid gave me the coin.
Geralt, Excellent. So where're we gonna get away to?
Triss, You? Nowhere.
Geralt, Glad I could help you collect it. You'll find good use for it?
Triss," It's finally possible, probable, even -- that we can get all the mages"
Geralt, Goodbye?
Triss, What happened at the fountain...
Triss," We shouldn't have... It was my fault, I know. The wine...went"
Geralt, Triss... Don't apologize.
Triss," I'm sorry, I acted irresponsibly. It was the wine, too strong."
Geralt, No need to apologize. It was...nothing.
Triss," Yes, nothing."
Albert, Miss Merigold...
Triss, We need to go.
Geralt, I know. Be careful.
Geralt, Guardsmen outside Triss' house. Not good.
Hunter, Strange. Butcher swore he saw her here.
Hunter, Maybe he lied.
Hunter, He lied when I cut off his first finger. They all grow very honest
Hunter, The ginger bitch hides behind her witchcraft... But we'll find her.
Geralt, What's going on here?
Hunter, Fungus in the city. We're scrubbin' it clean.
Hunter, Why you wincin' that mug like you stepped barefoot in dung?
Geralt, Mind your manners.
Hunter," Mind our--? Heh, be glad we don't smash your snout, mutt!"
Hunter, Wait. Grab him. I'll teach him his place.
Geralt, Relax. I'm going.
Hunter, Hah! Look at that -- tail between his arsecheeks!
Hunter," Freaks're learnin' their place. Slow, but they're learnin'."
Woman, Murder... Everyone saw it!
Triss, They came for me. And for you.
Woman, Are you daft?! Wanna get us killed?
Geralt, What's the problem?
Woman," Wha--? Slaughters a hunter on our doorstep, and then asks what the"
Geralt, We can hide the corpse.
Man, The whole street saw what happened. The guardsmen'll come. Turn us in!
Triss," Calm down. We've put you at risk, true. But we'll make it up to you."
Triss, But I paid in advance! The entire month!
Woman, You did...but you paid the old price. The risks are greater now and so
Triss, I'm out of coin...
Man," But you've got somethin' else, dear."
Woman, Give us the necklace and get out of here.
Geralt," Hands off, or I'll cut 'em off."
Triss, Geralt. You don't need to.
Geralt, I wanna. Grab your things and let's go.
Triss, Stop. I'll take it off myself.
Woman, Get out. Now!
Triss," When I need your help, I'll ask for it."
Geralt, What? Are you angry?
Triss, Argh...angry? No.
Geralt, Sorry... Didn't know if you wanted me to interfere.
Triss," I didn't. Their behavior -- disgusting, I know."
Triss, But they deserved the necklace. They risked a lot just by sheltering me.
Geralt, I was worried about you. City's crawling with hunters.
Triss," I know. We had everything in place, we were ready to sail...but the"
Geralt," They took a risk, sure. For a hefty fee."
Triss," Yes. The thing is, they could've taken the coin and turned me over to"
Geralt," Please, don't make excuses for them."
Triss," Geralt, we could debate morals, or any number of other topics, but I"
Geralt, How can I help?
Triss, Everything's falling apart. I don't know where to start.
Geralt," Actually, this is the perfect time for a moral debate. We can start"
Triss, Would you abandon Vesemir? Eskel? Lambert? Leave them behind just to
Triss," I should get all the mages to the docks as soon as possible, get them"
Geralt, Berthold and Anisse? Who're they?
Triss," A young couple. He's an alchemist, had a practice in Gildorf. She"
Geralt, Won't be easy getting to the port. Lots of guardsmen in the streets.
Triss," So we won't take the streets. In case of trouble, we were all supposed"
Geralt," I know the Novigrad sewers. Won't run into any hunters there, but"
Triss," That's why I'm asking you. I need you to find the way to the docks,"
Geralt," Triss, I can't do this, I can't help. Ciri's in danger and... I'm"
Triss, So am I. Sorry. Shouldn't have said that. I understand. I'm hurt...but
Geralt, We will.
Triss," And if you change your mind, you'll find me at the Kingfisher. At"
Triss, Now you understand my predicament?
Geralt, Mhm. Help two and put the others at risk... Or go straight to the
Triss," What do I do, Geralt?"
Geralt, We should help Anisse and Berthold. To write them off like that...
Triss, Fine. But then we need to go now. Clock's ticking.
Geralt, Lead the way.
Geralt," Can't risk everything, everyone for two people. It's unwise...and"
Triss, I was afraid you'd say that. Fine. Let's go to the Kingfisher.
Hunter, That's her!
Hunter, Seize the whore! Alive!
Geralt, Where's this hideout?
Triss," Not far, in the Bits. Now, quiet, Geralt. We'd rather not draw any"
Hunter," Hey you, witcher! Why are you here?"
Geralt, Just takin' a walk.
Hunter, With no destination? That's called loiterin'.
Hunter, And loiterin's banned by decree of Heirarch Hemmelfart. Take him in.
Geralt, Looking for a fight.
Hunter, Is that so? Got anything else to say?
Geralt, Yeah. This is your lucky day.
Triss, Dammit. Hear that? Something's going on.
Landlord," This is them, just as I said. Foul sorcerer and his whore. She's into"
Hunter, Good work. Take 'em!
Berthold," No, I beg you. We've done nothing wrong!"
Hunter, Right. Hear that several times a day.
Landlord, What...what about my reward?
Hunter," Reward? Ah, right... Got to go to headquarters for that. We don't pay"
Hunter, Merigold. And the witcher.
Triss, We tried. Let's go to the Kingfisher. This time we can't blow it.
Geralt, You all right? Can you walk?
Anisse, Y-yeah... Yes.
Berthold, I'll not leave here. I'm no fool!
Anisse, Berthold...
Berthold, Have you seen what's happening out there?! They'll catch us before
Geralt, We're going. Now.
Berthold, Go-going.
Triss, Thanks.
Geralt, I can't guarantee you'll be safe if you come with us. But if you stay
Anisse, He's right.
Berthold, We'll hide somewhere...wait it out.
Anisse, Darling...I beg you.
Berthold," Shut up! I told you last winter we should leave. But no, that"
Geralt, How much they pay you for them?
Landlord," Please, sir... Mercy!"
Geralt, How much? A bushel of grain? A barrel of herrings?
Landlady, Leave him by! I talked him into callin' the guard... They would've
Geralt, You have no possible excuse.
Landlord, Don't kill us...
Geralt, I'd never dull my blade on the likes of you.
Landlady, Harber. Harber!
Geralt, Let's go.
Geralt," Get out of here, or you'll burn anyway."
Landlord, But... How's that?
Geralt, Guardsmen'll decide this was an ambush. You know the penalty for
Landlady, But this is our home. We can't just...
Geralt, Do what you want.
Triss, We need to join the others a soon as possible. Stop. Hear it?
Hunter, There! Two more! Grab 'em!
Geralt, Have you checked the sewers beneath the Kingfisher?
Triss," No. Didn't think we'd have to take that route. To think, a year ago"
Geralt, You could stay. You'd manage it somehow.
Triss, The others will never make it without me.
Geralt, No guardsmen or hunters in sight. Everything seems in order.
Triss, Or we're too late...
Olivier, Aaaaargh!
Triss, Dammit. They're here already.
Triss, Dammit... We took too long.
Geralt, Too long? We set out to rescue two people.
Triss, Yes. And lost one.
Geralt, Knew exactly what he signed up for.
Triss, Small comfort...
Geralt," Good thing we got here before they found the hatch, grabbed the"
Triss," This is not about numbers, Geralt..."
Triss," This is no time to mourn. Come with me. This way, Geralt."
Geralt, Have you checked the sewers beneath the Kingfisher?
Triss," No. Didn't think we'd have to take that route. To think, a year ago"
Geralt, You could stay. You'd manage it somehow.
Triss, The others will never make it without me.
Triss, A patrol. We can't let them see us. All right. They're gone. Come on.
Geralt, No guardsmen or hunters in sight. Everything seems in order.
Triss, Or we're too late...
Olivier, Triss! Thanks be to Melitele!
Triss, Anyone from the Silverton hideout make it?
Olivier," Odette, Caspar...Ditmer and Janne."
Triss, Hagen?
Olivier, He... He won't be coming.
Triss, Decided to join us after all. I'm glad.
Olivier, Quickly. Before someone comes in.
Mage, Triss! What happened upstairs? Is everything all right?
Triss, No. Everything's not all right.
Mage," Triss, we were so concerned."
Triss, Right to be. Hunters were on my trail.
Triss," Geralt, wait a minute. I need to see who made it."
Reuven," Why the tears, my dear lady? You shouldn't worry yourself -- it"
Geralt, Guess you must've worried quite a bit.
Reuven, No. I was born ugly.
Geralt," You fleeing to Kovir, too?"
Reuven," No, but I am helpin' the others set off. You know me...bleedin' heart"
Geralt," Yeah, I know you. Don't have a heart -- bleeding or otherwise."
Reuven," Frankly, I'm surprised at your insight into my anatomy. But on a"
Geralt, It only started bleeding now? They've been burning mages for months
Reuven, But only since recently on this scale. Besides...
Reuven, I look forward to having friends in Kovir. Especially among King
Mage, Shh. Triss is about to speak.
Reuven, We'll talk later.
Triss," We waited long to escape. Till we could make sure Kovir would take us,"
Mage, This is madness. Hunters stand on every corner.
Triss, So we'll get to the port through the sewers. Geralt will clear a safe
Mage," They'll catch us anyway. You'll see. They'll catch us, and kill us."
Triss," Perhaps. In which case we'll die with dignity, weapons in hand... Not"
Geralt," Gonna enter the sewers now. I'll signal when the path's clear, you"
Triss," I will go with Geralt. You, Dijkstra, go to the port and see that"
Reuven, On my way.
Triss, We'll meet there. I hope.
Geralt," If the need arises, I'll defend you."
Reuven, You can also count on my help.
Mage, Yes...the help of a Redanian spy. Radovid's right-hand man.
Reuven," That was long ago, sir."
Mage, You raised that madman. You taught him to kill. You--
Triss, This is no time to settle past scores. End of discussion.
Geralt," Triss...really wanna go with me? No offense, but--"
Triss, Offense taken. Stop talking and lead the way.
Mage, Good luck.
Triss, Thanks for helping.
Geralt, No need to thank me. Really.
Triss," No, there is. You don't know how much it means...to have someone you can"
Geralt, It's all right. It'll be over soon.
Triss, Mhm. Soon.
Triss, Dammit! No way through! All is lost.
Geralt, Relax. Maybe there's another way.
Triss, Where? The passage is straight as an arrow -- not a single fork.
Geralt, But listen -- there's an echo behind the walls. And I can feel air
Triss, So...something on the other side?
Geralt," Mhm. Elven ruins or an old, forgotten cellar. Maybe we can get around"
Triss, Can't hurt to try. Got nothing to lose at this point.
Geralt, A library...?
Triss, Look! Gonzalo de Verceo's poems... Jacob of Varazze's chronicles...
Geralt, We'll come back for them later.
Triss," No, we won't. I leave Novigrad today, remember?"
Geralt, I remember. Just having a hard time coming to grips with it.
Triss, Come on. We should hurry.
Geralt, Triss! Found an exit.
Triss," Oof... For a minute, I actually thought we were doomed."
Triss, Stop. Hear that? What is it?
Geralt, Rats.
Triss," Oh, my speciality, remember? You've got nothing to fear."
Geralt, Depends how many there are.
Triss, Dammit... That's a lot.
Geralt, Lovely. No wonder there were so many rats.
Triss, Who's tossing all these corpses down here?
Geralt," We're right under the main square. Next to Carlo ""The Cleaver"" Varese's"
Triss, His debtors have tended to disappear without a trace.
Geralt, Everything all right?
Triss," A few bites on my feet and calves. Nothing, really."
Geralt, Need to clean your wounds. Infection'll set in otherwise.
Triss," Later, Geralt. Let's find the way to the port, first."
Geralt, A lesser vampire. Stay close to me.
Geralt, It's a katakan!
Triss, A what?!
Geralt, A vampire! Watch out for its venom!
Triss, The sewers always this exciting?
Geralt, Mhm. Luckily.
Triss, Luckily?
Geralt," Steady source of income. C'mon, let's go."
Triss, Seagulls! Hear them? We made it! C'mon. We need to ready the ship before
Reuven, Finally. You took bloody long enough...
Triss, Did you have time to look around? How's the ship?
Reuven," Creaky piece of junk. Wood's rotting, sails're prone to rip like an old"
Triss, Will we make it to Kovir?
Reuven, Provided you don't run into any storms.
Triss, I'll signal the others to come.
Reuven," Need any help? Can I play the violin for you, fetch some flowers or"
Geralt, What the hell's that mean?
Reuven, What...don't tell me you don't plan to beg her to stay?
Geralt, Don't meddle in other people's lives.
Reuven," Sorry, I must. It's my profession. So...will you ask her to stay?"
Geralt, Why do you even care?
Reuven, I adore love stories. Especially the ones that end happily ever after.
Triss, Hunters! Hunters approaching!
Hunter, Board the ship! We want them alive!
Triss," Dijkstra, I don't know how to--"
Reuven," No time for courtesies, my dear. Get on board."
Triss, One last farewell.
Triss, Thank you. I'll never forget what you did for me... And what we had
Geralt," I'll remember you, too. Always with a smile."
Mage, Miss Merigold!
Triss, Coming! Take care...and give Ciri a kiss from me once you find her.
Geralt, Stay with me.
Triss," Geralt...not this again. Especially not here, not now."
Mage, Miss Merigold! We gotta sail.
Geralt, Please.
Triss," We had our chance, but...let it go."
Geralt, I...I love you.
Triss, Miss Merigold! We're castin' off!
Geralt, Let's try again.
Triss, I don't have the strength to try. If I was sure it would work...
Mage, Miss Merigold! We're castin' off!
Geralt, I'll miss you. Terribly.
Triss, I know how you feel.
Mage, Miss Merigold! We're castin' off!
Reuven, You're an arse.
Geralt, What?
Reuven, An ass. An oaf. A twit. Didn't even try to stop her.
Geralt, I had my reasons.
Reuven," Course you did. You're an ass, an oaf, a twit. But even an arse"
Geralt, I'll ask again -- got interrupted last time. Why the hell do you
Reuven," If I say it's because I like you, want what's best for you, would"
Geralt, No.
Reuven," Wise. You should stay out of politics. I know it, you know it, and"
Reuven," Well mate, at least you tried. A sorceress turned me down once. Want"
Geralt, Go for it. What's the harm.
Reuven," As you know my heart fluttered for Philippa Eilhart, back when we"
Geralt, Pinstripes hadn't slimmed you down enough?
Reuven," No. She said she preferred women. So, I drank myself stupid and"
Geralt, There a moral in that story for me?
Reuven, No. An instruction: just do what I did. Later. Once we've spoken.
Geralt, Rather hear why the hell you care about my relationship with Triss.
Reuven," If I say it's because I like you, want what's best for you, would"
Geralt, No.
Reuven," Wise. You should stay out of politics. I know it, you know it, and"
Geralt," Ugh, Dijkstra...what are you plotting this time?"
Geralt," Sure this is the right time, Sigi? Triss and I just--"
Reuven," Spare me, Geralt. Witchers're stripped of feeling, not one emotion"
Geralt, Mhm. And that is?
Reuven, What would you say -- how many mages did we save? All together.
Geralt," Dunno, didn't count... Thirty, maybe, give or take a few."
Reuven," And how many would you say remain in the North? How many alchemists,"
Geralt, Doing a population count? Is that it?
Reuven," No, I'm concerned. In Novigrad, they had us, we were here... But who'll"
Geralt, Moving as speeches go. Now get to the point. Why're you telling me
Reuven, Because I want you to help me kill Radovid.
Geralt," I don't kill kings. Just not a regicide, rumors to the contrary be"
Reuven, I know. I'm merely asking for your aid in organizing the
Geralt," Ugh, Dijkstra...might not've heard this, though I'd find that hard to"
Reuven," Oh, bollocks. That's a convenient excuse you lot try to hide behind"
Geralt, I'll think about it.
Reuven," So long, Geralt."
Geralt, You that concerned about the mages of the world? Expect me to believe
Reuven," Actually, yes. But not because I'm sensitive or it gives me a"
problem, a madman rules Redania. I
Geralt," Its armies, I'd wager."
Reuven," And you'd bloody lose, you idiot. Mass mobilization, inciting"
Reuven," Well mate, at least you tried. A sorceress turned me down once. Want"
Geralt, Go for it. What's the harm.
Reuven," As you know my heart fluttered for Philippa Eilhart, back when we"
Geralt, Pinstripes hadn't slimmed you down enough?
Reuven, No. She said--
Geralt, Rather hear why the hell you care about my relationship with Triss.
Reuven," If I say it's because I like you, want what's best for you, would"
Geralt, No.
Reuven," Wise. You should stay out of politics. I know it, you know it, and"
Reuven," Geralt, turn around."
Geralt, Not in the mood for jokes.
Reuven," No, I'm serious. Turn around."
Geralt, Triss?! I thought--
Triss, So did I. But I changed my mind.
Geralt, Thank you. I'm...grateful.
Geralt, Good thing women can be changeable.
Triss," Dijkstra, no offense, but..."
Reuven, Leaving. Already gone.
Triss, Let's go somewhere. I know a spot where we can watch the ships.
Geralt, Lead the way.
Triss," They're safe now, right?"
Geralt, Yes. You can stop worrying. Really.
Triss," Oh, you're right. Just...hard to believe it's over and done with. I've"
Geralt, This how you imagined things?
Triss, No. I imagined I'd be on the ship with the rest of them. And you'd be
Geralt, I hope you don't regret it...that things have gone differently...
Triss," Well, they say Kovir's lovely this time of year... But I prefer you."
Geralt," Haha, not surprised. I'm pretty lovely this time of year, too."
Triss," I won't disagree. We might still go there one day, when it's all over."
Geralt," I dunno. Kovir seems so far away, end of the world, really."
Triss, Hmm. Maybe you're right... So how do you envision our future?
Geralt," I'll be grandmaster of the Order of the Flaming Rose, you'll be High"
Triss," Oh no, won't get out of it that easy. I asked you a serious question."
Geralt," I'd like us to keep moving, live on the road, wherever our legs"
Triss, Yes. Forgot you're not the type to settle down.
Geralt, That's true. I don't get attached to places. Just people.
Geralt," This is how I see it. We're living in a small town, where everybody"
Triss, And what're you doing? Running around swamps killing drowners?
Geralt," No, I'm sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, smoking my pipe..."
Triss, That simple?
Geralt, Mhm. That simple.
Geralt," Don't know. No idea, honestly."
Triss, Trying to weasel out of answering again. You rascal.
Geralt," No, it's just, instead of dwelling on the future, I'd rather live"
Triss," I missed this Geralt, you know?"
Geralt, Meaning?
Triss, The Geralt who's not afraid to open up to me. Tell me what he really
Geralt," What I want? Hm, one more thing..."
Triss, Shh. I know.
Geralt, That would mean balls and banquets and other boring things starting
Triss," Mhm. But also baths, balms, body massages... You could make up for"
Geralt, Sounds tempting. Would I have to give up being a witcher?
Triss," No. You'd take a monster contract from time to time, to stay sharp..."
Geralt, Let me guess...with a candlelit dinner.
Triss," Candles, sure. And a bed. Actually... We've never needed either."
Geralt, Promise me one thing -- you'll stop risking your life for others.
Triss, No.
Geralt," No? Triss, not a mage left in Novigrad."
Triss, But you're here.
Geralt, I can defend myself.
Triss," Well, from kikimores, griffins, bruxae...but not from the Hunt. You"
Mage," Look! They're signaling us! It's a message! ""H...l...a...k...b...r..."""
Mage, It's code. What did you expect?
Triss," Thank you, Geralt. For this...and for what you said at the port."
Geralt, I should've said it long ago.
Triss," So...what happens now? Afraid it's a bit too early for ""happily ever"
Geralt," I've gotta find Ciri. I'm close... I will find her, or someone who"
Triss, Where will we meet?
Geralt, Can only think of one place where both witchers and sorceresses are
Triss," Kaer Morhen. Haven't been there in a while. So, I guess I'll see you,"
Geralt," I'll miss you, too."
Geralt, We'll get our happy ending. One day.
Triss," Yes. Somewhere, over hill and dale... It's a cruel world we live in."
Geralt, You were in an entirely different mood a moment ago.
Triss," ""Hush. The spark expired."" Don't worry about me, Geralt. And please,"
Geralt, Men's fragrance... Acrid sweat...and chestnut balm for aching joints.
Reuven," Ah, those witcher senses. Can't hide a damn thing from you lot."
Geralt, Same seems to be true for you. Will you ever leave me alone?
Reuven," Someday, sure. Once I no longer need you."
Geralt, Mentioned you have a problem.
Vernon, Mhm. It's Ves. She took a couple of the lads across the river. Plans
Geralt, So? Sounds like what you guerilla fighters to.
Vernon," Yes, when they are ordered to. Whereas I forbade her from leaving camp."
Geralt," All right, so you've got a problem -- insubordination. What am I"
Vernon, I doubt Ves has entered the village. More likely she and the boys lie
Geralt, Count me in.
Vernon," Thanks, Geralt. I'll owe you a favor. Meet me in Velen, beneath the"
Geralt," Sorry, Roche. Rather not get involved. This is between you and Ves."
Vernon, Mhm. Hard luck. Don't let me keep you.
Geralt, Why Mulbrydale? Why'd Ves go there?
Vernon, The peasants from the village aided us earlier. The Nilfgaardians
Geralt," Hm. Honestly, Ves' desire to save the villagers makes sense. What"
Vernon," War means death. Not only for soldiers, for common folk, as well. You"
Geralt, Funny. Had you for an idealist.
Vernon," You were right to, are right to. But I have one ideal -- a free"
Geralt, Don't trust Ves anymore?
Vernon, Bollocks. She's prepared to die for me. That's not the problem. Know
Geralt, The uniform?
Vernon, It's a serious question.
Geralt," A rhetorical one. So instead of waiting for an answer, just..."
Vernon," Soldiers think tactically. They know when to strike, when to fall"
Vernon, It's the village below. Black with Nilfgaardians already. They're
Geralt, No sign of Ves.
Vernon," She may be impetuous, but she's not stupid. She's waiting for her"
Geralt, Shh.
Vernon, What now?
Geralt," A trio. Lightly equipped. Over there, near the--"
Ves, Death to the Black Ones!
Soldier, (in Nilfgaardian) To me! They're attacking!
Geralt, Looks like we're too late.
Vernon," Idiot! Geralt, we have to help. Follow me!!"
Vernon," Gods dammit, Ves! Have you gone completely mental?! You ignore my"
Ves," You're not my father, Roche. You've no right to tell me what to wear."
Vernon," But I am your commander, and you will obey me! Guerilla warfare."
Ves, I could not abandon them. They helped us.
Vernon," It's a soldier's job to kill, Ves, not save, not rescue. If that is not"
Soldier, Akh akh akh...ptooey...akh! Fuck...
Geralt, One left.
Geralt, Uh-oh. Got yourselves a prisoner.
Ves, We don't take prisoners.
Ves," You took my weapon, Roche... So I must manage with my bare hands."
Vernon, Leave him alone. There are corpses enough here.
Ves, What?
Vernon, You heard me.
Ves, I did and I can't believe it! He came here to murder civilians. He's seen
Vernon, Emhyr knows we can kill his men. Let him learn that we can also show
Geralt," Roche... Noble of you and all, but occasionally, I work for"
Vernon," I don't like this... But so be it, you certainly don't deserve to"
Ves," Well said, Geralt. A good Black One's a dead Black One. I'll strangle"
Vernon, Stand aside. I'll do this.
Soldier, (in Nilfgaardian) No... I beg you!
Geralt," Roche is right. Besides, killing a defenseless--"
Ves," What is it with you, Roche? Did the witcher take your stones? They're"
Vernon," I will explain later. You, Nilfgaardian. Piss off."
Soldier, (in Nilfgaarian) Thank you. I shall not forget you d--
Vernon," Go, before I change my mind."
Vernon," Agh. We should go before a patrol comes along. Thank you, Geralt..."
Vernon, Where the bloody hell did you go?! Berry picking?!
Geralt," Roche, I--"
Vernon," I have no desire to talk to you, Geralt. Goodbye."
Madame, White Wolf! Welcome to the Passiflora! Oh -- no sign of recognition in
Geralt," Greetings, uh..."
Madame," Don't fret, I'm sure I look quite different from when we last saw each"
Geralt, Er...which was...?
Madame," Oh, eons ago. You and Master Dandelion appeared, two halflings in tow."
Geralt," Yeah, sorry, but I'm here to..."
Madame," Speak softly. I know very well why you're here. They await. This way,"
Madame, This way. Upstairs.
Bandit, Witcher Geralt? Up you go. Boss has been waitin'.
Reuven, Geralt. You're here. Good.
Geralt, Might've chosen a more secluded spot to plan an assassination.
Reuven," It's on everyone's mind, many'd like to do it, so there's nothing to"
Geralt," Comparing yourself to Falka? Far as I can recall, no one in Redania's"
Reuven, Her rebellion changed the course of history -- that's what we have in
Geralt," Got your invitation, decided to come. That simple. Let's get down to"
Geralt, Thought about what you said...that Triss and Yen will never be safe
Reuven," You better believe it. Well, I'm pleased we've arrived at an"
Geralt, Came by 'cause I'm curious.
Reuven, But you will help?
Geralt," We'll see. Need to know what you expect of me, first."
Reuven, I believe you know my associate.
Geralt," Roche? You, here?"
Vernon, Retired intelligence operatives -- we've a club.
Geralt," Defended a king once... Ready to assassinate another, now?"
Vernon, Not proud of it. Yet...I considered all the options and found none
Geralt," All right, what do you want from me?"
Geralt, How's that work? Seems to me Radovid is Temeria's ally.
Vernon," Only as long as my guerillas do what pleases him, support his troops."
Reuven, But we didn't bring you here to bore you with politics. Radovid's a
Vernon, One of our co-conspiritors ventured out to meet an informer. He's not
Geralt," Tracker, huh? Really. Anything else you can tell me? Where this"
Vernon, He's traveling as a journeyman. Itinerant cobbler -- that's his cover.
Geralt, Fine. I'll talk to Gregor.
Vernon, Thank you. And try not to draw too much attention...if you can.
Geralt, I know. I'll try not to fuck it up. See you.
Reuven," We're counting on you, Geralt."
Geralt, Know what -- rather not get involved. Stinks of politics from miles
Reuven," Geralt, give it some thought. If you change your mind, find Gregor."
Geralt, I'll consider it. Promise you that much. But that's all.
Geralt, Let a Redanian soldier in on your plan to murder Redania's king?
Reuven," Ahh, you see? There are even some Redanians who cannot abide"
Reuven, Anyone see you come in?
Vernon, No one apart from Madame Serenity and your lackey.
Reuven," Off the street, I mean."
Vernon, No one. Nerves getting the better of you?
Reuven, I'm not nervous -- just cautious. A trait you ought to nurture as well.
Vernon," I know, and I am. Wound about the streets for a time to lose any tails."
Geralt, Looking for Gregor.
Gregor, You've found him. Who're you?
Geralt, Geralt of Rivia. Dijkstra sent me.
Gregor, Been expectin' someone. Let's take a walk.
Geralt, Nice job decorating your guard post.
Gregor," By orders of our gracious and merciful ruler, the good king..."
Geralt, What was their crime?
Gregor, One on the right's a pellar from a village nearby. Gave some bloke the
Geralt, Just humans at each others' throats. That's not Radovid's fault.
Gregor," Hm, who do you think set down the laws that mean folk hang for such"
Geralt, Let's talk. Must know why I'm here.
Gregor," Take it's about our cobbler friend. Yeah, he came through here on his"
Geralt, Thanks. Good enough to start with. Farewell.
Gregor, Hold on. You got a pass? Won't get back through without one.
Geralt," Yeah, I got one."
Gregor, All right. Good luck.
Geralt," Thanks, see you."
Geralt, Seem to have lost all respect for the king. Why serve him?
Gregor," What'm I to do? I was born a Redanian, I won't desert. Besides, I"
Geralt, Hm... Cart doesn't look damaged. Strange. Need to look around. Might
Geralt, Greetings.
Troll, Away go witchygo. Shoeses pick me.
Geralt, I can see that. Just wondering how those shoeses wound up here.
Troll, Here shoeses grow. Like to mushroo.
Geralt, Shoes don't sprout from the ground. You see who left them behind
Troll, Hmm... Hmm... Speakno Rogg. Or angergets Ogg and Pogg.
Geralt, Ogg and Pogg -- those are your friends?
Troll," Finderingers great Ogg-Pogg! Human finder on bigshoes cart, shoes"
Geralt, Mhm. What'd they do to this human?
Troll, Ogg Pogg mans cavetotake. Thereover.
Geralt, D'you eat him?
Troll," Naaaaayno, bonymans, stringymans. Blech... Oggmake mans shoesesmake."
Geralt, You even need shoes?
Troll," Shoeses on humanses, shoeses wants Ogg, Pogg and Rogg. Biglords"
Geralt, So long.
Geralt, Troll cave must be nearby.
Troll, Ogg angergets and you diemake!
Thaler," When someone pisses you off, you needn't ploughin' kill him. It's not"
Troll," When but Ogg hitmake, humanses alltime die."
Thaler," So don't bloody hitmake. Yell at 'em, that's good enough."
Troll, Heeeeeh?
Thaler," You walk up to the bloke, bare your teeth, furl your brow and say,"
me," ""You thrice fucked¹ whore --"
Troll, Errr... You... Yooooo...
Thaler," Argh, all right. Pogg? Maybe you could give it a shot?"
Troll, Errr...
Thaler," Agh, guess we should start with something simpler. Err, gimme a minute."
Troll, Fu... Fu... Fuggy?
Thaler," Shite, no! ""Fucking cunt!"" Bugger me, you're a moron..."
Troll," Ogg no morony! Ogg Tala finder! Ogg finderinger! And you cobbleringer,"
Geralt, Thaler? Shoulda known. Who better to teach trolls how to cuss.
Thaler," Geralt?! My, my, been bloody years."
Troll, This who?!
Thaler," Relax, Ogg, this bugger's an old friend of mine."
Troll, Buggafrenold go! Or wes in soup throw!
Geralt, I'd make for an awfully veiny morsel.
Thaler," Right, true that. Just look at the ploughin' bastard -- naught but skin"
Troll, Tala no go! Tala sit...sit arsedown! Tala sockcuck shoeses make!
Geralt," Got no time to negotiate with trolls. Step aside, Thaler."
Troll, Rooog! Here comes! Helps Rogg!
Troll," That do you why?! Shoeses pick Rogg, calmy kind, no ohn hurt! Rogg"
Troll, O yoooooo! Fu... Cu... Cuckfunt!
Thaler," Heheh, didn't I say you were a moron, Ogg? Told you a hundred times"
Troll, Ogg angergets! Ogg hitmake! Diemake! Diekill... Cu... Cucky!
Thaler," Fuck me, Ogg. You're never gonna get it."
Troll, Ogg bigforce! Cobbleringer in gosoup!
Geralt, I can see you've made friends. But Thaler needs to come with me.
Troll, Blood nowhere Tala go! Tala shoeses makes!
Geralt, But I need him.
Troll," Tala here stay. You shoeses got! Ogg shoeses gotnot, Rogg gotnot,"
Geralt, Now let's all stay calm. Thaller'll¹ be back. He just...needs to
Troll, Heeeeeh?
Thaler, Listen to Geralt. He's tellin' the ploughin' truth.
Troll, Heeeeeh?
Thaler, Look at your feet -- they're fuckin' mammoth. Need a damn bale o'
Troll, Shoeses Pogg for? And Rogg for?
Thaler," Two pairs, for each of you gnarled pricks."
Troll, Hmm... Tala go. But backcome must!
Thaler, Knew you buggers were good mates. Sit tight. Be back in a bit!
Thaler," Got to admit, you have a way with trolls. Ever thought of having"
Geralt," Children aren't trolls and vice versa. Besides, witchers're sterile."
Thaler," Ugh, you've not changed a bit. Still tart as rotting rhubarb."
Thaler," Infernal fuckin' mess. We should sod off. Truth be told, you didn't"
Geralt, Looking for apprentices?
Thaler," Fuckin' hell, them? Don't even think about it. I'd kill myself with"
Geralt, Didn't have time for nonsense.
Thaler," Just happen to be passin' through, or did someone send you to find me?"
Geralt, Roche and Dijkstra.
Thaler, Ah! Mean they've not forgotten me? That's nice. Though I am grateful
Geralt, Heard you three are planning to do some killing of your own.
Thaler, Huh? They tell you? Clowns.
Geralt," Kinda. Didn't offer any details, though. Maybe you'd be willing?"
Thaler," Sorry, mate. If they were mum, I've got to be mum."
Geralt, Hm. Be that way. How'd you even wind up out here? Nilfgaard occupied¹
Thaler, You sayin' the Black Ones have no use for cobblers?
Geralt, Probably brought their own.
Thaler," Brought fuck all, as I see it. Amateurs in uniform. And you'll not find"
Geralt," Yeah, right."
Thaler, You doubt me?
Geralt, You're a spy. And you're working with Roche and Dijkstra now. Doubt you
Thaler," Ah, I see you've thought about this. I admit it. Cobbler act's my"
Geralt, Like?
Thaler, That's all I'm willin' to say.
Thaler," Thanks again, Geralt. I'll take it from here. And I'll be sure to tell"
Geralt, So what'll you do now?
Thaler," What do you mean? Head back to Novigrad. Dijkstra, Roche and I've got"
Geralt, I'll ask again -- details?
Thaler," Forgive me, mate. I ploughin' can't. See, were it just up to me, I'd"
Geralt, Right. Got you.
Geralt," Tell me, you were a fence in Vizima. How'd you become a cobbler?"
Thaler, Picked the least suspicious profession. The fence thing -- shite
Geralt, Whereas a cobbler travels everywhere.
Thaler," Better believe it, heheh. Even cobbled together this fancy rollin'"
Geralt, Lovely.
Thaler, Bloody bullseye -- I've made a small fortune out of it since the war
Geralt," So long, Thaler. And good luck."
Thaler," Oh, I can bloody use it. Radovid's one crafty whore with the clap."
Geralt, Careful it's not also blathering about three assassins drawn and
Thaler," Heheh. Fear not, Geralt. We know what we're doin'. Farewell."
Man," Begone from the village, barren whore!"
Yennefer, You'd best take that back.
Man, Ye defiled sacred ground! The gods'll never for you for this!
Man," Ye ain't welcome here, witch!"
Geralt, Always did know how to win friends.
Yennefer, I was provoked.
Geralt," Mhm, saw it happen. Wanted to talk to me about something?"
Yennefer," Amos var Ypsis, a specialist on djinns -- heard of him? I found a"
Geralt, They know what happened to him?
Yennefer, The locals say they last saw his ship off the coast of
Geralt, So he's probably fish food by now.
Yennefer, Not necessarily. I must learn what became of him.
Geralt, Why? D'you know him?
Yennefer, No. It's not the mage who interests me -- it's his djinn.
Geralt, All right. So what exactly do you expect me to do?
Yennefer, You must help me find this djinn.
Geralt, You sure this mage actually had a djinn?
Yennefer," His books strongly suggest he did. He describes taming one,"
Geralt, Storm wouldn't pose a threat if he'd had a djinn. He could just utter
Yennefer, Perhaps he had none left. Or something unexpected happened...
Geralt," Why're you even interested? Djinns are dangerous sometimes, and"
Yennefer, I remember. But the advantages outweigh the risks. If I can tame a
Geralt, Know where to look -- for the mage and the djinn?
Yennefer, The locals say they last saw Amos' ship off the coast of
Geralt," Doubt we'll find them, then. Mage is probably fish food, and the"
Yennefer," Not necessarily. But even if it is so, I'll not give up without"
Geralt, You sure this mage actually had a djinn?
Yennefer," His books strongly suggest he did. He describes taming one,"
Yennefer, I've no gold to offer in reward...but I shall be ever so grateful.
Geralt," Since you put it that way...fine, I'll help."
Yennefer, Thank you. A boat awaits in the harbor. Come.
Geralt," Sorry, Yen. You wanna go djinn hunting, I'm afraid you're on your"
Yennefer, The most I can hope to accomplish on my own are a few chats with
Geralt, Do what you gotta do. I'm going to see the baron. Collect Uma from
Yennefer, I shall join you as soon as I can.
Geralt, So you've managed to prepare everything already.
Yennefer, I have.
Geralt, How could you possibly know I'd agree?
Yennefer, I didn't. Decided to risk it...
Geralt, Lead the way.
Yennefer, Just once you might try to take the initiative.
Geralt, Would you even let me?
Yennefer, It would depend on the situation.
Yennefer, The ship carrying the djinn sank somewhere in this area.
Geralt, Not too precise as leads go...
Yennefer, I'll cast a spell on our boat. We'll know if there are any wrecks on
Geralt," All right, let's get to work."
Yennefer, Mind if I take the helm?
Geralt, Ugh. I got a choice?
Yennefer, No.
Geralt, Not sure this djinn thing's a good idea.
Yennefer, We managed to seize one before. Do you remember?
Geralt, Course. Dandelion almost lost his voice that time.
Yennefer," Haha. How lucky your ""exorcism"" saved it. It was poetic."
Geralt," Yeah. How was I supposed to know your incantation meant ""Begone and"
Yennefer, You should have studied foreign languages.
Geralt, Gonna keep bringing that up for the rest of my life?
Yennefer, Of course. Your last wish effectivey assured it.
Geralt," My wish was about us being together always, not about you mocking my"
Yennefer," ""Careful what you wish for."" And when your wish is granted, you must"
Geralt, Yeah...
Yennefer, And as for your missteps -- I don't rightly see why I shouldn't laugh
Yennefer, There's something here... On the bottom. It's too deep here. You
Geralt, You underestimate me.
Yennefer," On the contrary. After all, I asked you for help. I'll cast a spell."
Yennefer, How's your bath? Water warm enough for you?
Geralt," Jump in, see for yourself."
Yennefer, Sea water wreaks havoc on my complexion. Just find the wreck.
Yennefer, How's it going?
Geralt," Yen, you know I hate it when you read my mind."
Yennefer," Strictly speaking, I'm not reading your mind, but using telepathy."
Geralt, Wouldn't admit it if I did. Not the point.
Yennefer, See anything interesting?
Geralt, A shipwreck and a cavern. I'll look inside.
Geralt," Snapped masts, busted planks, and a whole swarm of drowners. Probably"
Yennefer, Not the right ship. Come back up.
Geralt, Where to now?
Yennefer, Wherever the leads take us.
Geralt," Say we find the djinn, what'll you do? Ask for a beautiful house, then"
Yennefer," Are we still talking about the djinn, or have we moved on to a"
Geralt, Doesn't much matter. Both make wishes come true. What would yours be?
Yennefer, You'll learn in due course.
Yennefer, Something's here. Another wreck.
Geralt, Let's see if our djinn's down there.
Geralt, Found a wreck. It's been here a while. Wood's rotted.
Yennefer," Look around, but be careful. Look for something that might indicate"
Geralt, Arrows stuck in the side. The kind Faroe folk use.
Yennefer, A death worthy of a Skelliger.
Geralt, Clan emblem indicates a Dimun man. So he was from Faroe. Men from
Geralt, Beautiful craftsmanship...
Yennefer, What do you have?
Geralt, A war horn. Bearing Clan Heymaey symbols.
Geralt, Got something. A Skelliger's buckler. Clan Heymaey symbols.
Yennefer, Donar's clan.
Geralt, Donar was a babe in swaddling clothes when this buckler landed here.
Geralt, Got a chest. Really old. Must've fell off the wrecked longship.
Yennefer, Can you open it?
Geralt, Hoping for pirate treasuer?
Yennefer, I hope to find the djinn. Try to open it.
Geralt, Now that's what I call war booty...
Yennefer, Have you found the djinn?
Geralt," No. But I found something that could be just as valuable to me, as"
Geralt," Longship belonged to Clan Dimun. Yen, doubt any of these boats were"
Yennefer," Come back, then. We must search elsewhere."
Yennefer, You're getting better at this.
Geralt, Go even quicker if you helped me down there.
Yennefer," I prefer to observe matters from up here, most definitely."
Geralt," Yeah, like when we went looking for the dragon and an avalanche swept"
Yennefer, I remember... Though I found myself admiring what I had right in
Yennefer, Something strange about those rocks...
Geralt, And there's something on the bottom. I'll see what it is.
Yennefer, See something?
Geralt," ""Something"" doesn't do it justice. A huge crater, as if a meteorite"
Yennefer, I must see it.
Geralt, Diving in after all?
Yennefer," No, I shall cast another spell. To see through your eyes. Now relax."
Geralt," What is it, then?"
Yennefer, The effect of teleportation. A powerful force cut out a fragment of
Geralt, Always claimed portals were dangerous.
Yennefer, I believe we're on the right track. Look for anything that might
Geralt," Fine, but get outta my eyes. Too cramped in here for us both."
Yennefer, Eys'u failte beydem aen eich'te Ilyvaid.
Yennefer, Amos was no pauper. It could very well be his ship.
Yennefer, what?
Geralt, Half a seal.
Yennefer, That'll do. Come back up.
Geralt, Only found half. Can you do anything with this?
Yennefer, I can use it to locate the other half. To within a dozen yards.
Geralt," And once we find that, we should find the djinn."
Yennefer, Exactly. Ready? I'll take us there on the count of three.
Geralt," Argh, no, not another portal..."
Yennefer," Stop whining. One, two..."
Yennefer, ...Three.
Geralt, Said you were gonna go on three.
Yennefer, I did. Look. We must search the area.
Geralt," Yen, not so fast. Gotta tell me what this is about first. Why do you"
Yennefer, But you already know. A djinn's power is priceless to a mage.
Geralt," Won't worm your way out of it, not this time. Tell me the truth, or"
Yennefer," You needn't resort to blackmail. You wouldn't learned, eventually."
Geralt, True. But after the fact. I want to know now.
Geralt," That I know, but I also want to know how you plan to use it. Wouldn't"
Yennefer, You're right. It's important... Even very important.
Yennefer," Ahh... How long has this been going on, Geralt? This thing between"
Geralt, So that's it... This is about my last wish.
Yennefer, You asked that djinn to bind us together forever. I want to ask this
Geralt, Why would you want to do that?
Yennefer, To see what it's like without it. To see if we'll still matter to
Geralt, I get it. You wanna know what'll happen if magic no longer binds
Yennefer," I want to know, if when the djinn's magic is gone, if we've any"
Geralt, Hm... Wondered that myself many times...
Yennefer, You see? We're just a step away from learning the truth.
Geralt, What if I don't want to know?
Yennefer, I'm afraid you no longer have a choice.
Yennefer," Come, let's search the ship."
Geralt," Seems Amos was quite the eccentric, asking the djinn to lift half his"
Yennefer," He didn't necessarily. Djinns are inherently mischievous, this one"
Geralt," In that case, I'd appreciate it if you didn't wish I'd disappear from"
Yennefer, I've yet to decide how to word it.
Geralt," Yen, think you should see this."
Yennefer, What do you have? It's Amos. Looks exactly like the etching in the
Geralt," If he died while being teleported, seal might still be on him..."
Geralt, Think the djinn did this to him?
Yennefer," No, it wouldn't attack its master. This looks rather like an"
Geralt, Always knew too much studying could kill you.
Geralt, Behold!
Yennefer," Bravo. Come to the deck, I've an idea."
Yennefer, Step back a bit.
Geralt, What're you gonna do?
Yennefer, Summon and tame the djinn. It's not likely to be happy. Stand at the
Djinn, Grrr...
Geralt, Take it you have a plan?!
Yennefer, You must weaken him while I draw him into the sphere!
Geralt, Care to trade places?
Yennefer, Just a bit more! I can feel his strength waning!
Yennefer, Got you! Your master died before uttering his last wish! I cannot
Djinn, Graaghh!
Yennefer, Do you see the spell that binds us?
Djinn, Graug!
Yennefer," Only a djinn can remove another djinn's spell! Remove this one, and"
Djinn, Auuutree neyyyvanaaath!
Yennefer, You are free!
Geralt, Storm's over.
Yennefer, Yes. It's all over.
Geralt, Maybe we should sit? You look a bit dazed...
Yennefer, I'm not. But we can sit.
Geralt, Feel any better?
Yennefer," I told you, I'm fine."
Geralt, Don't need to play tough for me. That was a hard fight. Maybe not as
Yennefer," Hmph. No comparison, I'm afraid. Half of Rinde suffered then. Now"
Geralt, We've improved. Last time we tamed a djinn we destroyed half of
Yennefer," Yes, we make a good team."
Yennefer," Thank you for coming, Geralt. I'd have had a much harder time of it"
Geralt," Well, never could say no to you."
Yennefer, Mhm...perhaps that will change now.
Geralt, Feel anything? That anything's...different?
Geralt, Not sure I'd have done it if I'd known what this was about from the
Yennefer, Then we'd never have learned the truth... Whether anything would
Geralt, Has it? Has anything changed?
Yennefer," Hmm... I expected... I don't know what I expected, actually. A bit"
Geralt, Djinn mighta cheated us after all...
Yennefer, Why?
Geralt," Cause¹ I don't feel that anything's changed, either. I love you, Yen."
Yennefer, And I love you.
Geralt, Ow. What was that?
Yennefer, It can't all be sweetness and light.
Geralt," Strange... Done that so many times, but...it felt like our first kiss"
Yennefer," It was, in a way. Besides...once you say ""I love you,"" a kiss has"
Geralt, Maybe we oughta test out a few other things? Amos' cabin looked
Yennefer," Not so fast, Geralt. We'll have plenty of time for cozy cabins"
Geralt, What's next? Got any plans?
Yennefer," That depends what you mean... We must find Ciri, and then defeat"
Yennefer, But...I doubt the world will end if we sit here a while. Ahh...
Geralt, Mhm. Think the spirits of Skellige favor us.
Geralt," Sorry, Yen. But...magic's gone for me."
Yennefer," Truly? But...how is that possible? I still feel the same, you"
Geralt, Means the djinn granted your wish...
Yennefer, Right. Fine. Good. Glad we've got that over with. We know where we
Geralt," Wait. Magic's gone, true, but that doesn't mean I don't like spending"
Geralt, Next time we go on horseback.
Yennefer, A horse would never make it down that mountain.
Geralt, What now?
Yennefer," Well, I'm due to appear in Vizima."
Geralt," Yen, what happened back there..."
Yennefer," Please, Geralt. There's nothing left to say."
Yennefer, ...was very nice. Let's not ruin it by hashing out the details.
Geralt," Fine... If you gotta go, go."
Yennefer, It shan't take long.
Geralt, Better not.
Geralt," I'm going to see the baron. Collect Uma from him, then we'll ride for"
Yennefer, I'm off.
Geralt," Me too. We'll collect Uma from the baron, then we'll ride for Kaer"
Yennefer, I shall join you as quickly as I can.
Geralt," See you, Yen. Take care of yourself."
Yennefer, Farewell.
Geralt," So long, Yen."
Sentry, Welcome to the home of Jarl Udalryk of the honorable clan Brokvar.
Geralt, Greetings. Wanted to see the jarl.
Sentry," Enter. Jarl's still speakin' to his seer, but they should finish soon."
Sentry, One thing -- watch where you step.
Geralt, How come?
Sentry, Jarl's not too fond of light. Makes it easy to trip.
Udalryk, ...And then... Then a storm broke. Waves reachin' high as the boom.
Hjort, Go on.
Udalryk," All of a sudden, the wind raged stronger. Heard a tumult off the"
Hjort, We'll be done in a moment.
Udalryk, ...And then a giant sea snake swam up and bit my arm off... The gods
spoken, a sacrifice is needed.
Hjort," To my mind it's about you defeating a snake, Jarl."
Udalryk, No. They demand a sacrifice. I'm sure of it. It's time.
Hjort, We must wait for a clearer sign. At least till your next dreaming.
Udalryk, I don't need no more signs.
Geralt, Looking for Cerys. Heard she stayed here.
Udalryk," An Craite's daughter? Aye, she was here."
Geralt, Where is she now?
Udalryk, Mmm... What?
Geralt, Cerys. Where's Cerys.¹
Udalryk, Dunno...dunno. Enough of the questions.
Geralt, I'm looking for Cerys. Any idea where she might be?
Hjort, I hope she's gone to the village. It's been a time since she visited.
Geralt, But?
Hjort, I worry she might have gone to Jarl Udalryk's old family home. Though
Geralt, Clan Brokvar have something to hide from the An Craite?
Hjort," No, it's not that... The house is a strange place. Many believe it"
Geralt," Great, I love haunted houses. Buy why would Cerys go there?"
Hjort," Before she left, she had a long talk with the jarl. Seems she wanted"
Geralt, With what?
Geralt, I say something wrong?
Hjort, You must forgive the jarl. Hasn't been feeling well of late.
Geralt," Is he sick? He didn't seem quite right during Crach's feast, but..."
Udalryk, Aaaaa!
Hjort," Forgive me, I must go to him."
Geralt, A promising start...
Geralt, Where's Cerys?! I've gotta find her!
Hjort, Err...I don't know. Ask around!
Geralt, Great.
Geralt," Damn, something's seriously wrong here..."
Geralt, Fresh footprints. Could be Cerys'.
Geralt, Cerys. Passed out. Gotta get her outta here.
Cerys, Wha-- What happened? Where am I? Oooo... My head -- pain's just awful...
Geralt," Got hit, with something heavy."
Cerys, Geralt... Why're you here?
Geralt, Came to look for you. Crach's worried. Taking you home.
Cerys, I won't go until I help Udalryk. The sword! Where's the sword?! I've
Geralt," You're not going anywhere. I carried you out of there a moment ago,"
Cerys, I have to--
Geralt, You have to tell me what's going on.
Geralt, So what's this sword all about?
Cerys," It's Brokvar, the ancestral sword of Udalryk's clan. I need it to lift"
Geralt, Why'd you go in there?
Cerys, I wanted to help Udalryk...
Geralt," Sure, he was acting strangely, but I don't see how your stroll"
Cerys," It would've, if only I'd found the sword."
Geralt, A curse?
Cerys, Long story. Years ago Udalryk and his little brother butted heads over
Geralt," Huh, serious insult in these lands."
Cerys, Serious enough for Udalryk to break a sacred law in Skellige -- he
Geralt, Guessing the old jarl couldn't let it pass?
Cerys," They chained Udalryk to a pike, up to his waist in the sea. Spent three"
Geralt, Most likely their father thought some hard work at sea together would
Cerys," We use sea outings as cures for many things... Sadly, this time it"
Geralt, Got a feeling this trip didn't end happily...
Cerys, Your feeling's right. There was an accident.
Cerys, A storm broke out and Aki fell overboard. Udalryk had his hands full
Geralt, Didn't hear...or didn't want to hear...
Cerys," Some folk on the isle had the same doubt, but none would mention it"
Geralt, What'd you plan to do with the sword?
Cerys, I thought Aki's ghost would want it back...
Geralt, The brother's ghost?
Geralt, What do you think? Did Udalryk kill Aki?
Cerys, I don't want to jump to any conclusions. But I do think whatever
Cerys," Long as I remember, folk've said Udalryk's the chosen one, the one the"
Geralt, So you believe Aki's getting his revenge. 'Cause Udalryk let him die?
Cerys, I've talked to Hjort. He swears Udalryk didn't start hearin' voices
Geralt, Daring theory... Not breaking any of your laws just by thinking it?
Cerys, Don't care. I don't believe it's the gods talkin'. Have you seen him?
Geralt, Thought he earned those in battle.
Cerys, If you call the strife in his heart and head a battle... I asked him
Geralt, Not a bad idea -- on condition it's a ghost we're dealing with. But
Cerys, What's that?
Geralt, Aki drowned at sea -- said so yourself. But the ghost haunts this
Cerys," Aki and Udalryk both lived here. Maybe that's why. Thanks for your help,"
Geralt, Out of the question. I'll get it.
Cerys, Really? Thanks. So I can go see Udalryk.
Geralt," No chance. You're weak. Might pass out again along the way. Wait here,"
Geralt, What is this about?
Cerys, So? D'you find the sword?
Geralt, I found it. Let's go.
Cerys," After you, then."
Geralt, Not yet. Wait for me.
Cerys," You and my da -- you were mates once, right?"
Geralt, Hope we still are.
Cerys, But... Well I heard you fell out over somethin'...or someone...
Geralt," Talking about that story with Yennefer? Long time ago, that. In fact,"
Cerys, But you and Yennefer'd already met?
Geralt," Err, things were never cut-and-dried with Yen."
Cerys, What is it about her? What is it that draws you?
Geralt," Dunno... Maybe, uh, it's 'cause I've never chosen comfort and ease,"
Cerys, Where's Yennefer?
Geralt, Hmm... Don't know... Why do you ask?
Cerys, I just wonder why she let you come to sea alone.
Geralt," What do you mean, ""let me""?"
Cerys," Nothin', not a thing... Just got the impression she doesn't like to let"
Udalryk, Horridly bright out here. Stings the eyes.
Hjort, The fresh air will do you good.
Udalryk, The gods won't be pleased.
Geralt, Ahem.
Hjort," Jarl, our guests, remember?"
Geralt, Couldn't help overhearing your conversation.
Udalryk, No worries. It's no secret.
Cerys, All in the Isles know Jarl Udalryk hears the voices of the gods.
Geralt, These voices you hear...
Udalryk, The gods. Their voices.
Geralt, It's not the gods.
Udalryk," Watch your words, foreigner. You're in Skellige, our land, and we"
Hjort," Jarl, the witcher surely meant no offense. Let us hear what he has"
Geralt, What happened to your hand?
Udalryk, I sacrificed it to the gods.
Cerys," Forgive him, Jarl. Geralt's got more to learn about our customs."
Udalryk," To hear the gods is a gift, not a sacrifice."
Geralt, More likely this is somehow related to your dead brother.
Cerys, I told Geralt of Aki. We concluded that--
Geralt," That the gods are angry at you, yet he's the reason. That's why you"
Udalryk, I... I didn't want to... Aki fell in the water... I...the gods will be
Geralt, Angry you want to make peace with your brother? Are the gods of
Udalryk, They are that just.
Hjort, Justice demands you return to the dead what is rightly theirs.
Geralt, Lemme help you. And I promise to do everything I can to keep from
Hjort," Heed the witcher, Jarl. Make amends to Aki and you'll surely please"
Udalryk, What would you have me do?
Geralt, Remember where Aki fell in the water?
Udalryk," Near the isle's east end, by the mouth of the bay. Current had swept"
Hjort, It's a dangerous spot. Treacherous eddies swallow a handful of sailors
Geralt, We need to sail there. Aki's ghost won't rest until Brokvar's returned
Udalryk," No, no, no, no! The gods. They'll be angry... I feel it."
Hjort," Fear not, Jarl. The gods love you, and they loved Aki. Surely they want"
Geralt," Well, maybe I can sail there. The sword should be returned -- that's"
Udalryk, Aye... Our clan ring.
Geralt, That oughta be enough. I'm off.
Geralt," Can't help wondering what that accomplished, if anything. Time to see"
Cerys, But why? Why'd you do it?!
Udalryk, I...I had to. The gods commanded it.
Cerys, No gods command men to do such things!
Geralt, What is this?
Cerys, Udalryk... The gods commanded him to poke out his eye.
Geralt, What? Why'd you do it?
Udalryk, Such was...the will of the gods. A sacrifice...for Aki.
Geralt, What did the gods want? Exactly. Do you remember? What'd they tell
Udalryk," They were angry. A voice said, ""You vile wretch. You didn't help"
Geralt, When'd the gods speak to you? Right after I left?
Udalryk," Shortly after. Sleep came over me, so I lay down. 'Twas then they"
Geralt, You always asleep when they speak to you?
Udalryk, Always.
Geralt, What do you see then? Do they try to summon you somewhere specific?
Udalryk," My old home. They command me to light torches, then speak from the"
Geralt," The gods speak from the shadows, you said. Is that why you don't"
Udalryk, In my dreams. Atimes I see their form. When the torches burn bright.
Geralt," To see the gods is a great honor. Maybe, with more light in your"
Udalryk," Lesser men are unworthy, they cannot gaze upon their faces."
Geralt, The gods always demand you offer them your suffering?
Udalryk," Only that pleases them, so they ask for more and more."
Geralt, The gods ever show you their form? Or are they always just a shadow?
Udalryk," Once, I steeled myself, gathered my courage, and in my dream made my"
Geralt," I returned the sword, but nothing's changed. It's not his brother's"
Cerys, What's wrong with him?
Geralt, Can we talk somewhere in private?
Cerys, The guest room. Come.
Cerys, Well? Know what it is?
Geralt," It's a hym. A post-Conjunction creature, very rare and very dangerous."
Cerys, Sounds unpleasant. Any way to defeat it?
Geralt, Hmm...two methods that work. In theory.
Geralt, Witchers' bestiaries say you have to spend a night in the hym's
Cerys," The haunted house, you mean? It's hardly cozy, but I wager you've"
Geralt, It's not about sleeping. You've gotta draw the hym out. It has to
Cerys, And it's sure to give as good as it gets.
Geralt, You've seen Udalryk. It won't be an easy fight.
Cerys, What's this other way?
Geralt, They say a hym can be tricked. You have to pretend to do something
Cerys, Geralt! Let's try it!
Geralt, Don't know anyone who's pulled it off.
Cerys, Well maybe no one's thought up a trick that was good enough.
Cerys, What's this other way?
Cerys," I know you're doubtful, but we should at least try to find a way to"
Geralt," Might not be as simple as it seems. Besides, neither method's perfect."
Cerys, What d'you mean?
Geralt, Udalryk might not survive an entire night in the hym's lair.
Cerys, You think the hym...would it try to kill Udalryk?
Geralt, No. That would mean losing its host. But Udalryk could just...expire.
Cerys, And the more dangerous it will be to you.
Cerys, Hmm... And what about the other method?
Geralt," The hym's a demon, and demons are notoriously hard to fool. Plus,"
Cerys, What?
Geralt," The hym attacks those who have a guilty conscience, truly believe"
Cerys," Yes. So for this to work, if either of us has an idea, we can't tell"
Geralt, Exactly.
Cerys, Hmm... And what about the other method?
Cerys, Both methods seem risky... But I still think we should try the trick.
Geralt, Don't know that I'm convinced.
Cerys, Just please don't tell me you have to consult Yennefer on such things
Geralt, Hmm... Trying the trick it can't hurt.
Geralt, What is it with you and Yennefer? Mentioned her several times
Cerys, Nothin'. I've just noticed that...you're often of one mind.
Geralt, Saying I'm hen-pecked?
Cerys, Not that you're especially different... Seems to happen to all men...
Geralt, What can I say...you've seen through it all.
Cerys, So. Shall we try trickin' it first?
Geralt, Yeah. Let's.
Geralt," Uh-huh. So to prove you wrong, I gotta do what you say now?"
Cerys," As long as my name's not Yennefer, no one would call you hen-pecked"
Geralt, Fine. Let's try to trick the hym.
Cerys, Good decision.
Geralt," Haunted house, the hym's lair -- the only place where anything like"
Cerys," After you, then."
Geralt, No reason to delay.
Geralt, Meet you there. Got something to tend to on the way.
Cerys, Fine. See you.
Cerys, Let's look around.
Geralt," Ciri! No, it's impossible! Dammit!"
Geralt, Looking to discourage me? Good. Means you're scared.
Cerys, Geralt! Come! Think I've an idea!
Geralt, Come up with anything?
Cerys," Yes, I've a plan -- one that just might work."
Geralt, Can I get any details?
Cerys, You've got to wait for me here. I won't be long.
Geralt," Uhhh, anything else...?"
Cerys," Said yourself -- you can't know the details. So no, nothing else. You"
Geralt, Hope you know what you're doing...
Cerys, So do I... So? Can we start?
Geralt, I'm ready.
Cerys," All right. I'll be back soon. In a meantime, get a fire goin' in the"
Geralt," I don't know what you have in store for me. Gotta prepare, at least"
Cerys, All right. Let me know when you're ready.
Geralt," You're asking me to put my life at risk, Udalryk's life at risk. I"
Cerys," I see. If something were to go wrong, it's true... So be it. Let's"
Geralt, No reason to wait.
Geralt, Wanna look around some more. Meet you there.
Voice, O'er there! She's runnin' to the old house!
Voice, Grab her!
Cerys, Take him! You must put him in the oven! Trust me.
Udalryk, Take care not to hurt the child! Give me the babe.
Cerys, In the oven! Throw him in the oven!
Geralt, Cerys had a plan. But we'll do it my way.
Udalryk, I'll deal with you later. Let's go.
Cerys, The hym won't leave on its own. This isn't over.
Geralt, Just made yourself an enemy.
Cerys, I'd 'ave made no such thing if you'd only trusted me.
Geralt, And tossed an infant in the oven? I don't think so.
Cerys, The babe would've been fine. Round back the oven there's another door.
Geralt, Hmm... Not a bad scheme. Just...risky. I'd rather do it the witchers'
Udalryk, Arrrgghh!
Udalryk, Ugh! Ugggh!
Udalryk, Why...?
Udalryk, Aki!
Cerys, The witcher committed no crime! You'll find neither despair nor guilt
Geralt, It's over.
Udalryk, Over?
Geralt," We tricked the hym. It thought I'd killed your child, abandoned you"
Cerys," But when it saw the babe was whole, unharmed, it had to go. You're"
Udalryk, Free...
Geralt, The hym's gone. So are the voices that tortured you. Let's get out of
Geralt," What Cerys did -- don't hold it against her. She wanted to help, banish"
Udalryk, Help? Casting my babe in an oven?!
Geralt," Things'll calm down, you'll talk, figure it out. She had the best"
Udalryk, Yet she did not win your trust.
Geralt, Cause¹ I decided to solve this the witchers' way.
Udalryk," No, no, no, no... It'll never end..."
Geralt," I know what haunts you, whispers in your ear, commands you to hurt"
Udalryk," But I hear it, clear as a bell. The voice speaks."
Geralt, The voice is that of a hym. The creature feeds on the guilt you feel
Hjort, And the bad?
Geralt, We gotta survive a night in the hym's lair -- your old house.
Udalryk," No. No, no! That'll end badly. It can't end well, I can feel it."
Geralt," Get yourself together. If we're to stand a chance, you need to be"
Udalryk, I am a Skelliger.
Geralt, There's no sense in going if you don't stay calm.
Hjort," Jarl, the witcher is right. He specializes in such matters, he's your"
Geralt, We need to prepare the house first. Light some torches in the main
Udalryk, And then?
Geralt, • Then you just need to wait for it to show up.
Hjort," Fear not, Jarl, we'll tend to everything. You should rest in the"
Geralt, Thanks.
Hjort, Will that suit you?
Geralt, Should do. Thanks.
Cerys, Udalryk...
Udalryk," Begone, lass."
Cerys, I'd never let your babe be hurt. You know that.
Udalryk, Yet you almost killed 'im!
Cerys, It was a trick. Wanted to cheat the creature that haunts you. Not a
Udalryk, Argh... What you did... It's hard to believe any good could've come
Cerys," All will be fine, you'll see..."
Udalryk, He... He shan't forgive me...
Cerys," The witcher will be with you. You'll manage, I know it."
Udalryk, Hope you're right.
Geralt, So? Ready?
Udalryk, A Skelliger's always ready. To defeat his foes or fall in battle
Geralt, Only one to fall today'll be the hym.
Udalryk, Need I prepare? What will happen?
Geralt," Ignorance is bliss, trust me. Just make sure you stay vigilant,"
Udalryk, Fine. So... What now? Shall we begin?
Geralt, I'll light the torches in the main room. That and your presence'll
Udalryk, And me? What am I to do?
Geralt," Just hold out. It'll whisper to you, tell you to do things. Could be"
Udalryk, I'll keep it together. I'll try.
Geralt," That's great, but if it's not enough, if the hym starts to get to"
Udalryk, So be it. Shall we start?
Geralt," Let's start. Think pleasant thoughts, don't let the hym drag you"
Geralt, Not yet. Gotta check one last time if everything's in place.
Geralt, Calm down. You can do this. Now get back behind the torches.
Udalryk, Aaaarrrgggghhhh!
Geralt, The hym's gone! I can't see it!
Udalryk, I saw...saw it sink into the ground.
Geralt, Into the ground? Must've weakened it enough so it hid deep within its
carefully, I gotta go
Geralt, It's over.
Udalryk, Over?
Geralt, I killed the hym. You're free. Let's get out of here.
Cerys, Well?!
Geralt, It worked.
Udalryk, What's happening? My head's spinning... I'm spinning in a maelstrom...
Cerys," Geralt, you said it was over."
Geralt, That's just fatigue. In time his mind'll return to normal.
Udalryk, What...what will I do now?
Geralt, You'll be fine. Key is to not give in to self-pity.
Geralt," You're disoriented, but don't worry, it'll pass."
Udalryk, I feel...as if someone's torn something from me.
Geralt, That's normal. The hym was a parasite. Bonds between parasites and
Udalryk, Thank you...I think. Farewell.
Cerys, I'll go with him. He seems confused.
Geralt, Good idea. Then what? What're your plans?
Cerys," I'll stay a few days, make sure he's healthy. And you? Gonna stay on"
Geralt, Don't know yet. Gotta gather my thoughts.
Cerys, I'm sure Yennefer must be growin' impatient...
Geralt, Good idea. Take care of yourself.
Geralt, What is it with you and Yennefer? Mentioned her several times
Cerys, Nothin'. I've just noticed that...you're often of one mind.
Geralt, Saying I'm hen-pecked?
Cerys, Not that you're especially different... Seems to happen to all men...
Cerys, Though I will admit you're not all bad. You trusted me -- a complete
Geralt, Appreciate it if you didn't tell everybody in the Isles. They'll
Cerys," Haha. Farewell, Geralt."
Geralt," See you, Cerys."
Geralt," Generalize much? I'd say when someone's got a good idea, there's"
Cerys, Is that why you wouldn't trust me with the hym? It was just a bad
Geralt, No. Just opted to do it my way.
Cerys, Worked out in the end. That's important. Thanks for your help.
Geralt, Don't mention it. Farewell.
Geralt, Heard Hjalmar came here to gather men for his expedition.
Jonas," Aye, he did. Such spirit! Stormed in, swept the bowls off the tables,"
cried," ""I'm sailin' off to seek glory, who's with"
Geralt, Guess that was enough to recruit a longboat full of men.
Jonas," Beh, they carried 'im out on their shoulders! Yellin' all the while,"
Geralt, Hjalmar seems popular around here.
Man, He's Crach's son.
Jonas," Clever lad, put together a fine crew: hearty drinkers and warriors"
Man, Vigi.
Jonas," That's him. Hoped to earn a new byname -- ""The Fearless."" Till now"
Geralt, They wanted to take back a forge? What's that about?
Jonas, Never heard the Undvikkers forged the best armor in these isles? Their
Man, Cause¹ we made our blades like the dwarves forged their sihils.
Geralt," Soft, layered core fitted with a hard steel coating."
Man, How d'you know? That's a Clan Tordarroch secret.
Geralt, Got some friends who're dwarves.
Man," Mayhaps you do, but the ore from the mines of Undvik, why not even..."
Geralt, Hjalmar must've had a plan. Tell me about it.
Jonas, Plans?! Hah! They didn't even know where to look for this giant. As I
Man," They say the giant came from over there, awoken by the frost that"
Man," Twas¹ a harsh winter, suited that man-eater perfectly! And it can only"
Geralt, Mhm.
Man, Another one don't believe Ragh nar Roog is nigh? You'll see... All o'
Geralt, So long.
Jonas, Glad to be of service. If you need to know more about Undvik or the
Axel, Whaddaya want?
Geralt, I'm looking for people from Undvik.
Axel, They're dead.
Geralt," See, now, I heard many survived."
Axel," Stubborn git, you are... Whaddaya wanna know?"
Geralt, You there when the giant attacked?
Axel," Aye, I was. One of the jarl's personal guards. Egh. I failed him. Lent no"
Geralt, Jarl of Undvik -- tell me about his death.
Axel," Jarl Harold Houndsnout... His whole crew died that night. Wilmar,"
Geralt, Harold was dead by then?
Axel," What? No, jarl fought like a bear! Slicin', and dodgin', and hollerin',"
Geralt, How did you manage to survive?
Axel, First I heard the giant growl to those flying sirens. Damn me if he
Geralt," Under stress, men see all kinds of things..."
Axel," I know what I saw! Rushed to help the jarl, but one of the cunts sunk"
Geralt, I should go.
Axel, Yeah...
Geralt, I'm looking for men from Undvik.
Rante, Javor's from the isle. And I once cut those waters with nary a rest.
Javor, I'm the one to ask! Me or Axel an Tordarroch. He's over there. What can
Rante, Heard you trillin' a different tune when Hjalmar was gatherin' his
Javor, Bahumum...
Geralt, Need to get to Undvik.
Rante," Another thrill seeker. Well, then listen close, lest you end in a"
Geralt, Stick to the point.
Rante," Err, um, fine. Watch for the currents, 'cause they can drag you off"
Geralt," Javor's from there, or so he claims, and you seem to know these"
Rante, Cause¹ that kind of expedition needs a true leader. And a whelp
Javor," ...you'd rather sit on your arse, nose in the air, you Zerrikanian"
Rante, You'd sail with anyone who'd let you aboard -- Crach's daughter
Geralt, You mentioned sirens. Many on Undvik?
Javor," So, soo¹ many. More'n on other isles."
Rante, Bollocks...
Javor," Once, they attacked Lars and me when we was fishin'. 'Fore we could"
Geralt, Drive away the sirens? How's that work?
Rante, Hah! Plain to see you're no islander! With a hornwall's horn. One toot
Geralt," Nice talking to you, but time I was on my way. So long."
Rante, Fair winds to you!
Geralt, I know that song. What're you doing here?
Octo," Look, men, another one. And so many times I've told 'em... What's that"
Geralt, I'm looking for Hjalmar an Craite. Word is he came to this isle with
Octo," Aye, saw him. As did Wilmar."
Geralt, Sure it was him?
Octo, Wilmar's got eyes like a hawk! They stood where you stand now. Poor
Geralt, They say where they were headed?
Octo," Did they, Wilmar? Oh, aye. Aimed to make camp in the old guard tower."
Geralt, Remember when this was?
Octo, When what was?
Geralt, When Hjalmar an Craite was here with his men.
Octo," Oh, that! No, I don't remember. Ya might ask Wilhelm, though."
Geralt," Try to come back for you, once I've found Hjalmar."
Octo, Hahaha! Sound awfully sure you'll find him. Maybe you can kill the
Geralt, Gotta go. So long.
Octo," Ey, if you really aim to return, mind bringin' me some solid twine?"
Geralt, I'll remember.
Geralt, Who were these men?
Octo, My crew. They swore never to leave me. Kept their word. Tall one's
Geralt, Why'd you...and your crew...stay?
Octo," We cannot leave. If we ventured it again, the giant would kill us all."
Geralt, Why'd the giant spare you?
Octo, Me and me crew and the sirens -- we're helpin' him build a longship.
Geralt, Why does he need a ship? Where's he want to go?
Octo, Promise not to tell no one? I trust my men to take the secret to their
Geralt, Promise. Won't tell anyone.
Octo, Fine then. Giant's gonna sail her out to defeat the gods come Ragh nar
Geralt," Not much game here, but I saw the giant give you food. Where's he"
Octo," Don't know, don't ask. Food suits me, suits me crew..."
Geralt," Over there, on the ground. Hand's got bite marks on it..."
Octo," Wha? Where? Wilmar, dammit, you're supposed to clean up! Couldn't keep"
Geralt, Thanks for your help. Take care. I should go.
Octo, Fare ye well.
Geralt, Cookin' something?
Troll," Aye, cooking."
Voice, Hey! You there! Help me! Water's gettin' hot! Ah! Argh!
Troll, Shut it!
Geralt, I need that man.
Troll, No! We win human from Myrhyff!
Troll, I figure riddle.
Geralt," Play me for the man, then. If I win, I take him with me. If I lose,"
Troll," Good, good! Hehehe."
Voice, What?! Ploughin' riddles? Now?!
Troll, No bubble!
Geralt, Forget it. I don't feel like negotiating.
Troll," First riddle: ""Lots eats, lots drinks."""
Troll," ""Big he be, steps big he, big he bash."""
Geralt, It's a clock.
Troll, Clock? This what...? Bad! To pot!
Geralt, Hang on. It's my turn.
Geralt, Answer's a whale.
Troll," Bad! It troll! Whale no step, idgit! Him in pot!"
Geralt, Hang on a minute. It's my turn.
Geralt," A troll, of course."
Troll," Grr... Good, troll. Now you asks."
Geralt, I don't have time for riddles.
Troll, You in pot!
Geralt," ""I'm light as a feather, but even a troll can't hold me for long."""
Troll, Eee... Err...
Troll, Hmmmm... Eee... Piss?
Geralt," The answer is ""your breath."" All right, your turn. But make it quick"
Voice," Hurry up, dammit!"
Troll," Cold and splashes... Umm, a rhyme, rhyme... ""Cold and splashes, wave"
Geralt, A corpse.
Troll, Bad!
Geralt, A rock.
Geralt, Snow?
Troll, Bad!
Geralt, In that case...
Troll, Soup break!
Geralt, Dammit. That took too long.
Troll, Riddle hard! Human cheat!
Geralt, I won fair and square.
Troll," Grr... Stupid riddle. Feather, troll not hold, not piss..."
Geralt, Can you walk?
Man," Argh. Aye, I'll manage."
Geralt, Let's get out of here. You all right?
Man," Never go in a sauna again, long as I live. Other than that, I think I'm"
Geralt, Thank me with a story. What're you doing on Undvik?
Man, Sailed here with Hjalmar an Craite aimin' to kill the ice giant. We
Geralt, Things not go according to plan?
Man," I've no notion where the others are. Those that survived, that is..."
Geralt, I'm looking for Hjalmar.
Man, Hjalmar? Curious where he is meself -- him and the whole crew.
Geralt, Any idea where Hjalmar thought he might find the giant?
Man, We learned where it has its lair -- in the caves above the village.
Geralt, How'd you get separated from the others?
Man, Had the watch for the night. Saw Egnar of Faroe steal Hjalmar's hornwall
Geralt, And? You catch up to him?
Man," Aye, in these caves. Bastard screeched so loud he drew the trolls."
Geralt, The expedition -- tell me about it.
Man, Started like the best ballads -- with a hearty storm. Sail whipped about
Geralt, Helmsman made a mistake?
Man, I'd say his ma made the mistake -- birthed him arseways or somethin'.
Geralt, You smashed into the rocks. What then?
Man," Lost a few men, had to drag the wounded on litters. And the sirens"
Geralt," Not your lucky day, it seems. What happened next?"
Man," We found that daft bugger in the ship, then pitched camp near the guard"
Geralt, Crach sent me here to find Hjalmar. New king'll soon be chosen on
Man," So it's started already. Hjalmar, ruler of all Skellige..."
Geralt, Doubt he's cut out for it?
Man," Hjalmar's irresponsible, stubborn and heeds no counsel. But he's a born"
Geralt, Cerys has put forth her claim to the throne as well.
Man," Cerys?! But she's-- Well, she's..."
Geralt," Like father, like daughter."
Man, What about Crach? He support her? He let her sail off on some daft
Geralt, It was pretty much a shock to everyone.
Man," Crach, too? Or did he encourage her? Tell her to set off on some mad"
Geralt, Wasn't thrilled. Especially since Cerys set out without telling him.
Man, Nor did she tell me. Where'd she go? Who'd she take with her?
Geralt, Spikeroog. And no one.
Man, She went alone! Damn the dogs! If Hjalmar'd only... Has she come back?
Geralt, Hadn't returned when I left Ard Skellig.
Geralt," Yeah, she's back. Did what she set out to do, too."
Man, Thank the gods.
Geralt, Think I know enough. So long.
Man," Wait, I'll go with you. Luckily the trolls didn't use my bow for"
Geralt, Good. Let's go.
Folan, Thorsten...
Folan, Arvid an Tordarroch. He was dead set on comin' with us...
Folan, Oh gods -- near twenty of 'em... But no Hjalmar.
Hjalmar, Folan! Thought you died! What happened? Where'd you go?
Folan, What happened's you mighta listened to me when I told you not to take
Hjalmar," Alone... Should've woke me. I'd 'ave listened to you then, but"
Hjalmar, Folan! I was sure you'd died! Where've you been?
Folan," Cerys has gone to Spikeroog! Alone! Couldn't wait, no, had to sneak"
Hjalmar, Cerys? She staked a claim to the throne then? And you'd 'ave rather
Folan, I'd 'ave liked to have the choice!
Hjalmar," Wait. Still need to thank you, Geralt of Rivia. I'll never forget"
Hjalmar," Hehe. Thanks, White One. If not for you that mighta taken me much"
Geralt, Geralt of Rivia.
Hjalmar, The Geralt of Rivia? Like in the ballad about the sorceress and the
Geralt, Looks like it.
Hjalmar," Right, well, forgive me. Just thought that all happened long ago."
Geralt, Visiting the isle.
Hjalmar," Very amusing, Geralt of Rivia. Everyone knows a true brute's taken"
Geralt, Not about to stop you.
Hjalmar," Then perhaps you'd like to join me? With my crew gone, I could use"
Geralt, Leif's dead.
Geralt, I can help.
Hjalmar," Hm... Agreed! With my crew gone, I could use a body at my side."
Geralt, Leif's dead.
Geralt, Your father sent me. He needs you on Ard Skellig.
Hjalmar, Impossible. Da knows I'll not return till I kill the giant.
Geralt, Situation's changed. The fate of all Skellige will be decided on Ard
Hjalmar, The fate of Skellige's bein' decided here. If I accomplish this
Geralt, The other claimants are already waiting at Kaer Trolde.
Hjalmar," Hm, seems I must hurry then. Time to face the giant. Comin' with?"
Geralt, We should see to your friend.
Hjalmar, Right. His wounds need tendin'.
Geralt, Not what I meant. He's dead.
Geralt, Take it you're gonna fight the giant whether I help you or not.
Hjalmar," Of course. But first, I need to patch up Leif, move him where he"
Geralt, Leif's dead.
Geralt, Where's the rest of your crew?
Hjalmar, Fought our way through a swarm of sirens to get here. Only a handful
Geralt, He's dead.
Geralt, Your crew -- what happened to them?
Hjalmar," Ah, it all started with a storm -- you see, then came the blasted"
Geralt, Seems more doomed than heroic to me.
Hjalmar," No, that's just the gods lookin' to see what mettle we're made of."
Geralt, You know me?
Hjalmar, Our bards sing ballads about you. And my father told me of your
Folan, So that ballad 'bout the witcher and the sorceress...that's you?
Geralt, Yeah...
Hjalmar," What? Nah, he's just unconscious. Lost a bit of blood, you know?"
Geralt, He's dead. Trust me.
Hjalmar, Swore he'd sink his blade into the giant's heart -- swore it on the
Hjalmar, Let's go.
Hjalmar, Comin' with me?
Folan, Stupid question.
Hjalmar," Join us, Geralt."
Folan, Was to be his last voyage...
Hjalmar, Hurry now! Pick up the pace!
Geralt, Just like Crach...
Folan, See you're rarin' to go.
Hjalmar," I'm tellin' you, ploughin' enormous whoreson he is!"
Folan, Wonderful.
Geralt, So I heard.
Hjalmar, Can't believe I finally got the bastard.
Folan, Ehh...
Geralt, Haven't gotten him yet.
Hjalmar," Geralt, help me smash that. We're sure to reach the giant's cave this"
Folan, I'll cover you. Position myself so as to keep the giant in sight.
Geralt, Getting colder... Gotta be close...
Hjalmar," Careful, now... One odd step and you could wake him."
Vigi," Hey, quick! Let me out 'fore he wakes!"
Geralt, Key should be around here somewhere...
Hjalmar," Wait. Know what they call Vigi? The Loon. For good reason, too. Best"
Vigi," What? You out of your bloody mind, an Craite?"
Geralt, I thought he was your comrade.
Vigi," He is, which is how I know what he's like to do."
Geralt," Let's free him. Giant's pretty big, looks pretty mean. We could use"
Hjalmar, Even one swung by a madman?
Vigi," I heard that, an Craite! Let me out right now!"
Geralt," Wait here, I'll look for the key."
Geralt," All right, guess he should stay in the cage, then."
Vigi," Whaa? I'll not forget this, an Craite! You want all the glory to"
Vigi," Hey, let me out! Quick!"
Folan, Shut your trap! I sat in a bloody troll cauldron with nary a murmur.
Vigi," Thanks, brother. I'll remember that."
Geralt, Let's get out of here.
Vigi, Right. Just as soon as I kill him.
Vigi, Don't even! No closer! He's mine! Get out of here! The whoreson's mine!
Geralt," Shut up, you idiot..."
Vigi, Hah! I knew we'd best him!
Folan, Vigi...you daft bastard.
Hjalmar, Vigi...you daft bastard.
Hjalmar, Hahahaha!
Folan, Hahahaha!
Vigi, Hahahaha! Heeheheh aahhh... But where are the others?
Hjalmar, Vigi. Poor bugger.
Geralt, Should've let him out.
Folan, Shouldn't blame yourself. We never knew with Vigi. Might've rushed
Hjalmar, And that might've spelled death for us all.
Hjalmar, Vigi. Poor bugger.
Geralt, Should've let him out.
Hjalmar, Don't blame yourself. Vigi wasn't exactly the predictable type. Soon
Hjalmar," Thanks for your help, White Wolf. Geralt the Giantslayer -- I'll make"
Geralt, Sure sounds better than the Butcher of Blaviken. So be it.
Geralt," ""Hjalmar the Giantslayer"" sounds better. It was your venture, you"
Hjalmar, Hm. Believe you're right.
Hjalmar, Let's get outta here.
Geralt, Let's go.
Geralt, Wanna look around some more.
Hjalmar," In that case, I'll meet you on the beach, near the port."
Geralt, Gonna head back to Ard Skellig?
Hjalmar," Aye, need to make it known, tell how bravely my boys fought. Make"
Geralt, Think everyone'll see it that way?
Hjalmar, I'm prepared to take responsibility for their deaths. I was in
Geralt," Farewell, an Craite."
Hjalmar," Thanks for your help, witcher. I've a distinct sensation, won't"
Geralt, Gonna head back to Ard Skellig?
Hjalmar," Aye, after all, I'm to be crowned. I killed the giant, I won back"
Geralt, Regret ever setting out on this expedition?
Hjalmar, What's that matter now? Giant's dead. And the folk of Undvik can
Geralt, Hadn't returned when I left Ard Skellig.
Hjalmar," Went to Spikeroog, you say... Venture she aims to face whatever's"
Geralt, Some say Udalryk's the gods' chosen one.
Hjalmar," They also say the gods are merciful. Witcher, uh, I'm certain"
Geralt, Islanders will see it as a great victory.
Hjalmar," Cause¹ Skellige is the victor, whereas I've lost me friends. I've"
Hjalmar," Aye, after all, I'm to be crowned. I killed the giant, I won back"
Geralt, And Cerys.
Hjalmar, Cerys? Me sis? But she's...
Geralt, She sailed off to Spikeroog. Alone.
Hjalmar, Alone? What on earth is was thinking?
Hjalmar," Someone oughta sail after her, stop this foolishness..."
Geralt," She's back already. What's more, she was successful."
Hjalmar, Oh... She always liked competin' with me. I've always won in the
Geralt," So long, an Craite."
Geralt, Set out to help Udalryk. Don't think she can do it?
Hjalmar," Oh, gods, Cerys... Uh, witcher -- you wouldn't happen to be"
Geralt," Yeah, I planned to go there."
Hjalmar," Good. Thanks, Geralt. I hope we meet again."
Geralt," Farewell, an Craite."
Geralt," Don't know yet. Your father asked me to, but...what if I help her,"
Hjalmar," Hahah! Hahaha! You helped me, too. Let's call it evenin' the"
Geralt, Thought you didn't fully trust them.
Hjalmar," Willin' to give them one last chance. So long, witcher."
Geralt," Mm. So long, an Craite."
Geralt, Probably not.
Hjalmar, Probably? So you may still change your mind? If you happen to be
Geralt, Of course.
Hjalmar," Thanks, Geralt. I hope we meet again."
Geralt," Farewell, an Craite."
Geralt, Surprised everyone.
Hjalmar, And da? Did he support her? Let her set off on some mad expedition?
Geralt, Wasn't pleased. Especially since Cerys didn't mention it to him
Hjalmar, Nor to me.
Arnvald, Master Geralt! A guard spotted you from the tower. They sent me to
Geralt, Why was it closed? This that famous Skellige hospitality?
Arnvald," Nay, 'tis tradition. After the feast, the jarls'll choose the king,"
Geralt, So maybe I oughta stop by another time.
Geralt, Crach make an exception just for me?
Arnvald," All know what you did for Cerys and Hjalmar. Today, you're one of us."
Geralt, How's the mood in there?
Arnvald, Calm. Too calm!
Geralt, How's that?
Arnvald," We've an adage here in Skellige... At a good feast, mead and blood"
Geralt, Not sure. Sounds preferable to dull banquets garnished with court
Cerys, I've as much right to it as you do!
Hjalmar," And I'd expect you to support me, not pinch my allies! If an an"
Cerys," Should be you? 'Cause you got fur growin' on your chin, that it?"
Hjalmar," Show some of your own, and the jarls just might listen to you!"
Cerys, Want your mug smacked? Remember! I was left standin' last time we
Hjalmar, Yeah? So you'll fight the Vildkaarls with me? Wonder who'll do
Cerys, Ugh! Stop your shite boastin'!
Hjalmar," Cerys! Hey! Ah, dammit!"
Geralt, Don't see Crach. He talking to the jarls?
Arnvald," No, went to his chambers. To prepare your promised reward, no doubt."
Geralt, Bad way to play it out.
Hjalmar," Think I don't know that? But you saw her, she's so...so..."
Arnvald, Stubborn? Fierce? Mule-headed? Refuses to listen to anyone?
Hjalmar, Exactly!
Arnvald, Ahem...
Hjalmar," Hahaha! True, Arnvald, me and Cerys -- we're near twins in that"
Hjalmar," If you've a spell, witcher, perhaps you'd fancy some fisticuffs with"
Geralt, Maybe later.
Geralt, Cerys.
Cerys," Heard us, didn't you."
Geralt, So did everyone in that room who's not completely deaf.
Cerys," Hjalmar wastes his time arguin' with me, and I really don't know why..."
Geralt, You're his sister. It's natural.
Cerys," We've always argued, but I thought somethin' like this... Thought he'd"
Geralt," Would you prefer he ignored you, refused to see you as a rival?"
Cerys, Perhaps you're right.
Geralt, You think you stand a chance?
Cerys, I don't know. That doesn't mean I'm givin' up. I'd never do that.
Geralt, Course you wouldn't.
Cerys," It's just, after Udalryk, solvin' his grief, I thought I'd gained some"
Geralt, Better get back to your guests. Won't gain any votes talking to me.
Cerys," You're right... Till later, Geralt."
Geralt, Hjalmar? Can you...?
Hjalmar, Ugh. Seal shit. Take a look. Still got all my teeth?
Geralt, Most of 'em. Did quite a number on you.
Hjalmar," Why're you laughin'? They'd 'ave trashed you, too."
Geralt," Huh, doubt it."
Hjalmar," That so? Care to wager on it? Drop any one of the Vildkaarls, and I'll"
Geralt, You're on. Start wrapping that sword for me.
Hjalmar," Don't sell your fish till they're in the boat, Wolf."
Geralt, Heard you're taking on challengers in fistfights.
Vildkaarl," Challengers? Argh, nay. Ain't none a challenge to us."
Vildkaarl, We're here to hit. Hit till our fists're red with blood.
Geralt, Let's do this.
Vildkaarl, Gladly.
Geralt, Vildkaarls? Who're they?
Hjalmar," Ehh, these wild men, live in the hills."
Geralt," Shepherds, then?"
Hjalmar," Aye. Without the sheep. They live off killin', eat only what they"
Geralt, Thanks. Got scars enough.
Hjalmar, See your bollocks've shriveled.
Vildkaarl," A witcher, eh? Ye fight more like a little bitch. Get outta my"
Hjalmar," Heheh, not so tough without your blade. Which is too bad, 'cause you"
Geralt, Here. May it serve you well.
Hjalmar, Hah! Can't wait to test a witcher's blade in battle!
Geralt," Listen, how about I give you the equivalent in coin instead of my"
Hjalmar," Shouldn't 'ave bet it then! But...fine. Owe you that much, for old"
Vildkaarl," Argh, pth! You hit good. Hard."
Hjalmar, Oh! What a fight! Smacked his gob so hard it's a wonder his brain
Geralt," Greetings, Birna. Feast not to your liking?"
Birna, This is no feast. It's a farmers' market where where votes are bought
Geralt, Leaving Kaer Trolde?
Birna," Tomorrow at daybreak. Enjoy yourself, Master Geralt."
Geralt, Svanrige's not gonna vie for support?
Birna, Bran's son will not haggle for a crown that is his by right.
Geralt," Far as I know, crown goes to the claimant who gains the most votes."
Birna, That is the tradition. But not all traditions are good. The Isles'
Geralt, What's wrong with voting for your king?
Birna," Take a walk, listen, and you'll understand. The claimants already"
Geralt, Take it you have a specific family in mind.
Birna, Of course. Bran was the best king Skellige's seen in centuries. The
Geralt, May I?
Crach," You must, even! Come, I've been waiting for you. So, feast to your"
Geralt, Definitely more to drink.
Crach," Aye, there is. Rolled all of it out of my cellars! Double meads, triple,"
Geralt, Promised me a reward for helping your children.
Crach, And I aim to keep my word. Here. This bauble's been in the family for
Geralt, Beautiful craftsmanship. Thanks.
Crach," Heh, I'm the one--"
Geralt, Something tells me there's a purpose to your hospitality.
Crach," Aye, there is. In the Isles, mead and meat stand to gain you as much"
Geralt," If that's true, you can rest easy about how the vote'll turn out."
Crach, I'll rest easy on the morrow. When the crown rests on one of my
Geralt, Feeling torn between Hjalmar and Cerys?
Crach," You mean, do I have a favorite? Nay. They're as different as fire and"
Geralt, Between you and me...Hjalmar's not too hot-headed to be king?
Crach, Depends on the kind of king you have in mind. Want one who'll send
Geralt," If you escalate your attacks, you stand to infuriate Emhyr. Could"
Crach, In Skellige we spit on the notion of peace at any cost.
Geralt, Think the council of jarls will dare to put a woman on the throne?
Crach," If you'd asked me some months ago, I'd 'ave laughed in your face."
Geralt, Saw you talking to Birna. What about?
Crach," Politics. After all, naught else interests her. Wench tried to"
Geralt, Why do I think you turned her down?
Crach, You put it mildly. I showed her the door!
Chant, Lu-gos! Lu-gos! Lu-gos!
Crach," Hear that? Dammit, Hjalmar's probably started another row."
Geralt, That's not Hjalmar. Let's go.
Holger, Cloth! Gimme some cloth! Gotta stop the bleedin'! Quick!
Halbjorn, Da... Da...
Madman, Take my cloak.
Holger," Hold on, son, you'll pull through. A shark grabbed my leg once..."
Hjort, He's dead.
Holger, Raaaaaaaaaaah!
Madman, Crach! Where'd those bears come from?! Heh?! Answer! Now!
Hjalmar, Careful how you speak to my da!
Madman," Stow your blade, pup! Or Crach'll lose a son, too!"
Crach," You insult me, Lugos. And now you threaten my son. I will not stand for"
Madman, Then come here! C'mon! Put you down like a rabid dog!
Donar, Calm down! Calm down! Enough blood's been spilt! Someone brought these
Udalryk," Find the guilty, an Craite. Find and kill them. Else your clan will be"
Geralt, Dammit! Things've sure gotten messy.
Cerys," That's putting it mildly. We've clues to examine, things to consider."
Hjalmar, We've no time for that. I know where to find the guilty.
Geralt, Anybody see how the bears got in?
Hjalmar, Don't matter. I know where to find the guilty already.
Cerys, Wait! Are you mad? You're gonna kill folk before we've learned what
Hjalmar," Learn all you want. Meantime, I'll go wash the shame off our clan."
Cerys, Hey! The jarls ain't listenin' anymore! Stop playin' the hero and think
Hjalmar," Our honor's at stake, sis. That can't wait."
Cerys," Are you listening to me? Someone let those bears in. We must know who,"
Geralt," You're right, Cerys. I'll help you."
Cerys, Thanks.
Hjalmar, Fine. See you when I return with the traitors' heads.
Geralt," I'm going with Hjalmar. Don't know where, but I'm going."
Hjalmar, Knew you'd not turn down an adventure!
Geralt, Pretty sure you can handle this fine without me.
Crach," Aye, we will. So long, Wolf."
Crach," I'll stay here. Someone must see to everything -- summon the healer,"
Hjalmar, We ride for Fornhala. At a gallop!
Hjalmar," Right, we're here."
Geralt, Meaning? Gonna explain what we're doing or not?
Hjalmar, Remember the wild men I sparred with? The ones we call Vildkaarls?
Geralt, You might've mentioned them when I walked in...
Hjalmar, This is Fornhala. Their village. They were the ones who changed into
Geralt, So what now?
Hjalmar," Simple. We welcomed the Vildkaarls under our roof, gave them food,"
Geralt, Nice and simple. Kind of plan I like.
Hjalmar," And that's why I like you. Come on, Wolf. The skalds'll sing of"
Geralt," Should at least take one alive, make him testify before--"
Hjalmar," This ain't the Continent, witcher. Don't need no court to see"
Geralt," Stopped to consider that somebody might've duped them, used them?"
Hjalmar," Then they'll die for bein' idiots. Enough jabberin', already. Let's"
Geralt, Vildkaarls -- what else do you know about 'em?
Hjalmar, They're not part of any clan. They've no wives nor children.
Geralt, So how do they reproduce? By budding?
Hjalmar, No. Those wishin' to devote their lives to battle come here to join
Geralt, Got a feeling it's more than gossip.
Geralt," Why not speak up right away? Back there, in front of everyone?"
Hjalmar," Cause¹ they'd 'ave started talkin'. Questionin', quarrelin'. Words"
Hjalmar," No one here. Ran away, knew I'd come for them."
Geralt," Odd. From what you said, they don't sound like the type to lack"
Hjalmar, Vildkaarls don't have families. Won't be anyone to mourn them.
Hjalmar," Look! Up there... A corpse, by my reckonin'."
Geralt, Mhm. Needs examining.
Geralt, A Skellige custom I don't know about?
Hjalmar," If it is, it's new to me as well."
Hjalmar, Fought bare-fisted. To the death. Some kind of trial?
Geralt, Probably. Or a very bloody sport. This one here... Doesn't look like
Hjalmar," Aye, true. More slender in the shoulders, no tattoos... Interestin'."
Geralt, An old shrine...covered in runes.
Hjalmar," I know the signs. Language of our forefathers. ""Svalblod."" Dammit..."
Geralt, What is it? That a name?
Hjalmar, Aye. A deity whose worship is banned. All altars to him were razed
Geralt, Doesn't make sense to fear the gods. Only ever dangerous in stories.
Hjalmar, The gods don't concern me... Their followers do.
Geralt, What'd this deity do to earn condemnation?
Hjalmar, Him? Nothin'. But those who promised him almost drowned Skellige in
Hjalmar, You see...Svalblod demands sacrifices. Human sacrifices. Sword at the
Geralt, *Sniff* Strange smell. Bit like incense... Bit like a bait we witchers
Hjalmar, For what?
Geralt, Bears.
Hjalmar," Crikey, you've a sniffer like a hound's."
Geralt, Better. Follow me.
Hjalmar," Don't matter. Body's still warm, they're close. Come on."
Hjalmar," Geralt, finish up your ferretin' already."
Hjalmar, Look. Someone walked through it.
Geralt, Tracks lead uphill.
Hjalmar, I'll bloody give 'em tattoos...
Geralt, Trapdoor under a bearskin rug... Classic.
Hjalmar, C'mon. Open it.
Geralt, Air's thick with incense.
Hjalmar, I'm gonna puke. It's as though--
Geralt, Shh. Hear that? Noise from below.
Hjalmar," Ah, finally."
Halgrim, Lookin' for death?
Hjalmar, Nay. Vengeance.
Geralt, And answers. Why'd you attack Kaer Trolde?
Halgrim, We didn't come to the feast to kill. But we've no regrets about what
Geralt, Strong blood? What're you talking about?
Halgrim, I speak of the she-bear and her cub.
Geralt, Like the men whose corpses we found?
Halgrim, Aye. Those who wish to join us enter the Ursine Circle in groups of
Hjalmar, We've talked enough.
Halgrim, Good. Talkin' tires me.
Geralt," Well, won't get anything else out of him."
Hjalmar," We don't need to. Everything's clear, blood for blood."
Geralt," Your vengeance, your rules."
Geralt, Realize they might've acted at someone's behest? Might've just been
Hjalmar," We an Craite have always had foes. Let them plot, let them strike."
Geralt, Voices... More of 'em further on.
Hjalmar, I'm countin on it. Let's go!
Druid, Svalblod! Svalblod! We summon thy power!
Hjalmar, Our forebears forbade all from worshippin' Svalblod. On pain of death.
Artis, What?! Where'd you--
Geralt, From Kaer Trolde. Bet you know why we're here.
Artis," Aye. On a matter that's naught to you, mutant. A matter of pride and"
Geralt," True, not my concern. Hjalmar, he's all yours."
Hjalmar, I could just butcher you like a swine...but I'll let you die with
Geralt, Didn't see any honor in what happened at Crach's castle. That was a
Artis," You see in darkness, yet are still blind."
Artis, We spilled that blood for Skellige. For a king we can be proud of.
Geralt, Don't give a damn about your motivations. Gimme a name.
Artis, I'd sooner die than tell you.
Artis, Arise! Arise! And drink of the blood!
Hjalmar, Not afraid to die. Gotta give 'em that.
Geralt," A letter... Turns out the Vildkaarls -- unwitting tools. This druid,"
Hjalmar, Who signed it?
Geralt, Nobody. Anonymous.
Hjalmar," You were right... There's someone else behind it all, all the mayhem."
Geralt, What now?
Hjalmar, I'll tell the jarls what we found here. Hope it's enough to clear
Geralt, Suspect anyone?
Hjalmar, I know many who crave the crown... But none who'd stoop so low to
Geralt," Whoever it is, they could strike again."
Hjalmar, And I'll be on my guard.
Hjalmar, It was them attacked us. The Vildkaarls.
Donar, Will you claim they turned into bears? That they're the berserkers our
Hjalmar, I saw them transform. With my own eyes.
Madman, Did you see Freya ride astride a wild boar as well? You discovered as
Geralt, I'll vouch for Hjalmar.
Madman," Why would we believe you, eh? You're a lackey to an Craite."
Donar," And a witcher. He knows beasts, including those that take on human"
Geralt," Send men to Fornhala, then you'll believe."
Madman," Been there. A shabby village, a few huts. What's there of interest?"
Hjalmar, A temple: to Svarblod.
Udalryk," Go on, Hjalmar."
Hjalmar," What about? I found the traitors, wrought vengeance on them. That's"
Geralt," No, not everything. The Vildkaarls conspired with someone. Found a"
Brina, Vague. This does not identify the guilty party.
Donar, That's not why we've gathered. You washed away disgrace with the blood
Crach, So 'tis true... Warriors who become bears...
Geralt, I'd say it's the opposite. I saw their transformative ritual... Our
Crach, The Vildkaarls have been punished. You and Hjalmar saw to that. But our
Geralt, No need. Again.
Crach, I'll not take any more of this modesty. This is a land of heroes! Let
Geralt, What do you think -- who'll get the nod?
Crach," Come with me, see for yourself. All may listen to our deliberations."
Geralt," I do have a horse in the race. Can't refuse, to be honest."
Crach," As I thought. Well, let's go."
Geralt, Might join you later.
Crach, Countin' on it. As are my children.
Cerys, Ever see anythin' like that?
Geralt, No. And I hope I never will again.
Cerys," Where'd the bears come from? We were all laughin', eatin', drinkin'..."
Geralt, We've talked enough. Let's look around.
Cerys, Lemme know what you find. I'll speak to the others. Maybe someone saw
Geralt, What happened before the massacre? Be precise.
Cerys, Yo-young Lugos bet he could empty a barrel of beer in one go. He
Geralt, We'll avenge them. I promise.
Geralt, Know who died?
Cerys," Drogodar, Draig Bon-Dhu, Blueboy Lugos, Halbjorn, Otrygg... Take some"
Geralt, But you could name the claimants to the throne who survived in one
Cerys, What're you sayin'?
Geralt, Nothing -- just yet.
Cerys," Pull yourself together, Sinna. How'd they get in?"
Sinna, Dunno... The gates were shut!
Warrior," Looked away a moment... Turned back around, saw a bear standin' by"
Cerys, For what? You're talkin' rubbish.
Warrior, So the tales are true... Warriors in battle frenzy transformed into
Cerys, Berserkers... But how'd they come to be here?
Geralt," All right, what do we have here...?"
Geralt," Bear's head, but the tongue's short, like a human's. Mouth smells of"
Geralt, Something under the fur...a tattoo? Shape of a bear paw.
Geralt, Old scar... Looks like it was sutured.
Geralt," Half-man, half-bear. Something like a lycanthrope. No full moon, so"
Geralt, *Sniff* Earthy scent from the bear's maw. Something towards...
Geralt, Mff. Here. Mead spiked with some kind of mushroom...and...human blood?
Cerys, A guard saw what happened. Those weren't bears. They were--
Geralt, ...men who transform into bears.
Cerys, Uh-huh. Berserkers.
Geralt, Think I know what caused them to transform -- the mead they drank.
Cerys, Hjort might help us. Few druids know herbs better.
Geralt, Can't hurt to try.
Geralt, Berserkers?
Cerys, The skalds' name for warriors who change into animals in the midst of
Geralt," Mhm. Almost. We were at a feast, not on a battlefield."
Hjort," Freya, our mother, may the sea swallow the traitors. Freya, our lady..."
Geralt, Mind if I interrupt?
Hjort, Already have. What is it?
Geralt," Someone spiked one of the mead barrels. With blood and something else,"
Hjort, Give me the horn. I know the smell... A mushroom -- mardroeme.
Geralt, Mardroeme. Never heard of it.
Hjort," You've another name for it on the Continent. Psilocybe, I believe?"
Geralt, All right. Peasants eat it to soothe pain.
Hjort," Udalryk tried it, too...but only a few times. In larger doses, the"
Cerys," Yes, the last thing Udalryk needed more of. Thanks for your help."
Geralt, Mardroeme related in any way to berserkers?
Hjort, Aye... But only in the tales told to children as they're put to sleep
Geralt," Only a legend, I know. Still, I find it easier to believe than some"
Geralt, Cerys wasn't lying. You know your fungi.
Hjort," I do. Especially those which affect the mind, soothe it, summon waking"
Cerys," But he's done with that now, right?"
Hjort, It's not that simple... But we'll wean him off it yet.
Cerys, Blood and mardroeme. The taste of human flesh and a substance that
Geralt," Maybe. Hard to believe someone spiked the mead here in the hall,"
Cerys, You're right. I helped prepare for the feast...I'd 'ave noticed. It
Cerys, We must find the traitors quickly. Elsewise the warriors will take
Geralt, Think they'd attack Crach openly?
Cerys, My father or each other. All in the finest Skellige tradition. Haven't
Geralt," Funny. Arnvald said the same. For a feast to be any good, mead's gotta"
Cerys, Might say he got his wish. I really hope Hjalmar's doin' something
Geralt," Relax. Your brother's impetuous, not stupid."
Cerys," We keep the poison at the cellar's other end, down below. Come, I'll"
Geralt, Mahakaman spirit. Someone ruined several barrels of the finest...
Cerys, Good thing da's got other worries on his mind.
Cerys, Right behind you.
Geralt, That's a relief.
Geralt, Shit...!
Cerys, The spirit!
Geralt, Akh akh akh...
Cerys," There's another exit behind the barrels. But they're too heavy, we'll"
Geralt, Don't intend to. Quick!
Cerys, Gods... We might've been burned alive!
Geralt, Somebody's damn desperate to bring our investigation to a quick end.
Cerys," One rarely used, more like. When Hjalmar and I were little, we'd play"
Geralt, When I get my hands on that pyromaniac--
Cerys, Let's think... They had to use the entrance we used... Maybe they left
Geralt," Maybe. When the door slammed shut and the fire broke out, did you hear"
Cerys," No, but I've no witcher senses at my disposal. You must hear the hair"
Geralt," Huh, I try not to eavesdrop. Anyway, entrance is worth checking. Come"
Geralt," Must've felt his clothing rip, but was in a hurry..."
Cerys, What's this?
Geralt, Piece of cloth.
Cerys, No... It can't be!
Geralt, What is it?
Cerys, Arnvald's tunic! Only he wears this kind!
Geralt, Sure about that?
Cerys, Saw him in the main hall with the servants. Let's go!
Cerys, Look! It's him!
Geralt, Grab a horse. We'll chase him down.
Cerys," Arnvald! Stop, dammit!"
Geralt, Doubt he'll listen...
Cerys, When I get my hands on him...
Geralt, You don't stand a chance!
Arnvald, We'll see about that!
Geralt, Shit... He's fast.
Arnvald," Quick, they're after me."
Warrior," No time to lose, then. Kill him."
Arnvald, Huh? Are you mad? I'm on your side!
Warrior, Not anymore.
Cerys," Geralt, we need him alive."
Geralt, Figured as much. Help me.
Cerys, Hah! Got him!
Geralt, Why'd you betray them? Talk. Or I'll finish what I started.
Arnvald, Why did you help me?
Cerys," Because I want to hear why you betrayed my father, my brother and our"
Arnvald, No an Craite should ever sit on Skellige's throne. I know you better
Cerys, Curious. Never heard you voice that idea. But I do know one who never
Arnvald, Yes. Birna Bran.
Geralt, Everyone needs to hear this. Let's get back to Kaer Trolde.
Cerys, Will you tell the council of jarls of the plot?
Arnvald, I will. I was ready to die for Birna... But not like this!
Cerys, The Thing will need to convene. Let's go!
Geralt, What was her motive?
Cerys," It's obvious. She schemed this up to get rid of the other claimants,"
Geralt," So, didn't get away after all. A small key...to a drawer or small"
Cerys, So? Find anythin'?
Geralt, Mhm. Arnvald's body... And this key. Had it on him.
Cerys, We've gotta search his room.
Geralt, Lead the way.
Cerys, Still can't believe Arnvald played a part in it.
Geralt, Know him well?
Cerys," Since childhood. He was always tight-lipped, secretive, but never hurt"
Cerys," Let's get to work. Search every nook, turn things upside-down if need"
Geralt, Think he'd be dumb enough to leave any evidence behind?
Cerys, He didn't expect to be pursued... Might not've managed to take
Geralt," ""The Song of Bran the Conqueror."""
Cerys, Bran the Conqueror's a hero to Clan Tuirseach. He took Skellige's
Geralt," Interesting, but it's hardly proof."
Geralt, Clothes all over the place. Think Arnvald might've been in a hurry.
Cerys, And a lone shoe. Unlike him -- he paid attention to how he looked.
Geralt, Wonder where the other one is.
Cerys, Think that important?
Geralt, Was wearing both on the beach. Remember that clearly 'cause he
Geralt, An empty envelope... Hm... Scene's familiar.
Cerys, Must say I envy you that.
Geralt, Ambergris. Means a user of perfume. That's the scene to follow.
Geralt," A hidden compartment...? Hm, might oughta try Arnvald's key?"
Cerys, A letter. I told you!
Geralt, Smell it? Birna's perfume...
Cerys," Never liked it, horribly suffocating. Might've guessed it was her."
Geralt, Read that letter already.
Cerys, Instructions on how to spike the mead... Some promises. But it's
Geralt, Think it's enough?
Cerys, It's got to be. We shouldn't delay any longer. Time to gather the
Geralt, What was her motive?
Cerys," It's obvious. She schemed this up to get rid of the other claimants,"
Donar," I've assembled the jarls in council as you demanded, Cerys an Craite."
Cerys, Birna Bran's.
Birna, The lass is mad. Do you think anyone will believe you?
Cerys, You had them serve poisoned mead to the berserkers.
Birna, I beg your pardon! The servants at Kaer Trolde are not mine to command!
Holger, There's reason in these words...
Donar, Have you any proof to confirm your accusation?
Cerys, I've better. I've a witness. Arnvald!
Arnvald, Cerys speaks true. Birna commanded me to poison the mead. When
Crach, You betrayed us? The clan that took you in?!
Birna," Good men! He's a servant to an Craite, a lackey! He will say what"
Lugos, Birna speaks true. Arnvald has served at Kaer Trolde ever since I
Cerys, Twas¹ my father's cupbearer Arnvald who helped him. Birna bribed
Crach, What?! Arnvald?!
Lugos," Aww, shite. Arnvald is Crach's loyal dog."
Birna," I thank you, Lugos... But so be it -- let us hear what slander"
Cerys, He's dead. And I wager it was you who silenced him.
Birna," I am not surprised to see you lie, Cerys... After all, like father,"
Donar," Silence, Birna! And you, Cerys... How do you aim to prove your"
Geralt, Got one more piece of evidence.
Geralt," Arnvald fled Kaer Trolde, rode to an agreed meeting point. The"
Holger, What's that to do with Birna?
Arnvald, Those men wore Clan Tuirseach colors.
Birna, This is no proof. It is inconclusive. Anyone might have donned our
Cerys, A letter from Birna to Arnvald -- instructing him on how to spike
Birna, It lacks my signature. It lacks my seal.
Cerys," But the hand is that of a woman, and you--"
Birna," Hahahaha! Is this your proof, lass? Is this what you call evidence"
Donar," Birna's right, Cerys. 'Tis all precious little proof of her"
Geralt, I can vouch for Cerys. She's telling the truth.
Birna, You? Yet another an Craite lackey? Did Cerys entice you to cooperate?
Crach, What did you say?!
Donar, Calm yourselves!
Udalryk," After what I saw on Spikeroog, I trust the witcher. More than I do"
Birna, You've that right. But it's no proof of my guilt.
Donar," Holger! Lugos! It's time we quit this damn castle. Come, we must decide"
Geralt," I'm sorry, Cerys."
Geralt, You're making a big mistake.
Birna," Silence, wanderer."
Svanrige, Wait! Mother... You bade me to leave the hall before the feast. Why?!
Birna, Son... Not now.
Svanrige, Why did you do it?! How did you know?! How?! You stand silent. You
Birna, Svanrige...I did it for you! Only for you!
Donar, You admit to this deed. As the eldest of the jarls I cleanse the name of
Crach," Birna had a lust for power, I knew this... But so strong as to commit"
Geralt, What about Svanrige? What's his fate?
Crach," He'll lose his home, his name, his honor. He'll choose exile...or"
Crach, So 'tis true... Warriors who become bears...
Geralt, I'd say it's the opposite. I saw their transformative ritual... Our
Crach, The Vildkaarls have been punished. You and Hjalmar saw to that. But

Geralt, No need. Again.

Crach, We're just in time.
Geralt, They've already started.
Donar, Weren't long ago we gave King Bran back to the sea. Today our mourning
Crowd, Skellige has chosen!
Crowd, An Craite! An Craite! An Craite!
Hjalmar, I know you've long awaited this day. We strike at Nilfgaard!
Cerys, I know some would see another in my place. I thank those who stood
Crowd, Cerys! Cerys! Cerys! Cerys!
Crowd, Hjalmar! Hjalmar! Hjalmar! Hjalmar!
Cerys," You're an idiot as a brother, but you'll make a good king..."
Hjalmar, I will. And I'm countin on you bein' at my side when we set out
Cerys, Won't you feel silly? Goin' into battle arm in arm with a woman?
Hjalmar," With my sis, of clan an Craite. Bravest lass the Isles ever made."
Hjalmar, You did well.
Cerys, Thought you'd be sulkin'
Hjalmar, Why would I? Showed 'em that even the lasses of Clan an Craite are
Cerys, But I beat you.
Hjalmar," If it had to be so, I'm glad it were you and not someone else."
Geralt, Congratulations. You'll make a great queen.
Cerys, Thank you. Wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
Geralt, Got a delicate matter I wanted to bring up. Need your help.
Cerys, What is it?
Geralt, Crach's mentioned Ciri to you -- he must've.
Cerys, Have you found her?!
Geralt," Not yet, but I'm close. Problem is, soon as I get her, the Wild"
Cerys," Hmm... I can't leave the Isles now, it's impossible. What I can do is"
Geralt, Think he'll be willing?
Cerys," I'm sure of it... In fact, I think he'll be overjoyed! Come on, you"
Geralt," Yeah, guess I do. Thanks."
Cerys," No doubt he'll be valiant. I hope he¹ proves useful, too. Good luck."
Geralt, What's the new queen of Skellige planning?
Cerys," Umm... To listen, learn and listen again. Then we'll see."
Geralt, Good plan.
Cerys," I must unite the clans. I'd rather avoid war, but if Nilfgaard aims"
Geralt, Drummond folk might be a problem. I saw Lugos during the ceremony --
Cerys, There's always been strife between our clans... But I must try and
Geralt, Keep my fingers crossed. Farewell.
Geralt, You earned this.
Hjalmar," Didn't I, now? Though truth be told, I'd rather 'ave beat a bugger"
Geralt, The Wild Hunt's preparing to attack Kaer Morhen. Could use your help.
Hjalmar, Wraiths at the gate of your witchers' stronghold? You're a friend of
Geralt, Thanks. Won't forget this.
Geralt," What now? Call up the crews, hit Nilfgaard?"
Hjalmar," We go back to the Black Ones now. Come out of the sea at them, we'll"
Geralt," Take care, Hjalmar."
Geralt, You all right?
Hjalmar," So so... Any way you cut it, I was bested by a wench."
Geralt, Not just any wench.
Hjalmar," Aye, true. Suppose if it had to be so, I'm glad it was Cerys."
Geralt, The Wild Hunt's preparing to attack Kaer Morhen. Could use your help.
Hjalmar, Wraiths at the gate of your witchers' stronghold? You're a friend of
Geralt, Thanks. Won't forget this.
Geralt," Not even a little proud of her? Come on, admit it."
Hjalmar," A bit, aye. She is the blood of me blood, bone of me bone. But don't"
Geralt," Yeah. Surprised to see him in that much of a huff, actually."
Hjalmar," Our clans've been buttin' heads, chests, bellies forever. It's the"
Geralt," Take care, Hjalmar."
Geralt, I was afraid you'd never talk to each other again. After that contest
Cerys, Who? Me and Hjalmar? You must be mad.
Geralt, Rivalry certainly seemed serious.
Cerys," Our rivalry's one thing, but we share the same blood -- that's what"
Geralt, Got a delicate matter I wanted to bring up. Need your help.
Cerys, What is it?

Geralt," Not yet, but I'm close. Problem is, soon as I get her, the Wild"
Cerys," I can't go...but do forgive me. Hjalmar's given me tasks, important"
Geralt, I understand. I should go -- gotta keep looking.
Cerys," Good luck, Geralt."
Geralt," So, not mad you lost?"
Cerys," Naturally I'd rather be standin' where he is now, but...my brother's"
Geralt, Farewell.
Geralt, Looks to me you're near bursting with pride.
Crach," Hah! If only you knew, Wolf! Tell me -- what other jarl can boast"
Geralt, Cerys'll make a good queen. Maybe she can finally unite the clans.
Crach," Let's hope. And if not, she'll always have me and Hjalmar. If the"

Crach," It'll depend on the matter. His brawlin' days are over, granted. But"
Geralt," So, Ciri was here..."
Geralt, Hm... A dedication to the baron and his wife. Seems they had friends
Geralt, So you're Gretka...
Gretka, I am. And you're Geralt.
Geralt, How'd you know?
Gretka, Because you've white hair and a medallion shaped like a wolf. Ciri told
Geralt," You and Ciri talked a bit, didn't you?"
Gretka, We did.
Geralt, Did she say where she was going? Or what she came here to look for?
Gretka," She said she was looking for you and a sorceress. But you're here, so"
Geralt, Ciri wanted to help a friend? Any idea who it was?
Gretka, What do you mean who? Her friend. She said he was in trouble and
Geralt, Do you know where Ciri is?
Gretka," No. One day I brought her breakfast, and she was already gone. The"
Geralt, Didn't ask where she'd gone?
Gretka," I did, but he said I was too little and I wouldn't understand. But"
Geralt, A gift?
Gretka," Yes, this. A green stone."
Geralt," Beautiful as gifts go. Hide it well, don't show it to anyone. It's"
Geralt, Look familiar?
Gretka, My top! Where'd you find it?
Geralt, Ciri's room.
Gretka," We'd play in her room sometimes. I was sad one day, and Ciri carved"
Geralt," Thanks, Gretka. Have fun."
Gretka, But I'm not playin'. I'm helpin'.
Geralt, Hmm... A tripwire. Never known a monster to set a trap. Someone's here.
Geralt, Movement... Oughta keep my ears open. Rustling...over there.
Geralt, Something's not right... Hmm... A sort of attic... Gotta get up there
Letho," Bravo, Geralt. Avoided all my traps."
Letho, Your reflexes have slowed. Hope you're not hurt. Those were my traps.
Geralt, Letho?!
Letho," Yeah, didn't expect to see you, either. You one of them?"
Geralt," Who's ""them""?"
Letho, To the emperor -- mercenaries. To themselves -- bounty hunters. To me
Geralt," ""Them""? You know I work alone. Question is, what're you doing here?"
Letho, Waiting for them. The ones trying to kill me.
Geralt," Well, got nothing to fear from me."
Letho, Did that already. Count on you remembering that when you collect
Letho, Accidents sure send you to strange places. Till recently this place
Geralt, 
Geralt, Hiding in a place overrun by monsters -- good idea.
Letho, Means people don't wander in by accident. And the ones who come on
Geralt, Assassins?
Geralt, Who'd you piss off this time?
Letho," Emperor just decided to get rid of me -- I'm an inconvenient witness,"
Geralt, Now I understand all the traps.
Letho, Gotten real careful.
Geralt, For good reason.
Geralt, Don't look a bit like lost travelers.
Letho, They're not. Means Louis sold me out.
Geralt, Louis?
Letho," Old friend, kinda. Did a few jobs together once, a while past. Louis"
Geralt, You've grown careless. Let yourself be drawn into a trap.
Letho, Nah. Only traps here are the ones I set.
Geralt, So maybe those men down below wound up here by accident.
Letho, Eat my own boot before I believe that.
Letho, Gotta get rid of them. Coming?
Geralt, Lead the way.
Geralt," This is between you and them. Not my problem, rather not get"
Letho, You got involved when you came here. We'll get rid of them quicker
Geralt, Hrgh. Knew I shouldn't have come here...
Geralt, We got a plan of attack?
Letho, Yeah. Improvise.
Letho, Goddamn fools.
Geralt, Shoddily armed for assassins.
Letho, They're just scouts. Came to see if Louis was telling the truth. Rest
Geralt, And your old pal probably knows where.
Letho, He was the only one knew I'd be here. Must've told them. Think me and
Geralt," Hmm, could be interesting. Love to see it."
Letho, Come along. Sight of two witchers should loosen his tongue that much
Geralt, In that case -- good luck.
Letho, Wanna come with? Sight of two witchers might loosen his tongue
Geralt," Put it that way... All right, I'd love to come."
Geralt," Maybe next time, Letho. Got something else to take care of now."
Letho," Sure. So long, Wolf. Nice seeing you."
Geralt, Same. Don't get killed.
Letho, Stay close to me. It's one of those places that's hard to find if you
Geralt, This Louis -- somehow doubt he's one of your best friends.
Letho," You know how it is in this trade. Drink with someone in the evening,"
Geralt, How'd you meet?
Letho, Was before Foltest kissed this world goodbye. Louis was a wanted man in
Geralt, And that's why you trusted him...? Felt he owed you one?
Letho, I was stupid. Stupidity can cost you. But betrayal costs even more.
Voice," Weapons, men. We got company."
Voice, Who's that comin'?
Voice, The giant with the scarred forehead. And some gray-haired bloke...
Voice, Louis won't be happy.
Louis," Leeethooo, greetings! Good to see you alive and well."
Letho, Oh yeah?
Louis," Course! We're old mates, ain't we...? Who's your friend?"
Geralt, Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Louis, Another one? What's this -- prime contract available in the area?
Letho, I don't drink with traitors and rats.
Geralt, Doesn't matter. And don't change the subject.
Louis," Subject? What subject? You just arrived. Sit down, care for a drink?"
Letho, I don't drink with traitors and rats.
Geralt, A new mate. Who knows you're a fink.
Louis," Who-ho! Let's be civil, now. Remember, you're on my turf."
Letho, Arnout Vester's men showed up at the manor. You were the only knew I
Louis, They been nippin' at your heels for a while -- said so yourself. Perhaps
Letho, Mhm. With your help.
Louis, You've not been here five minutes and already you've offended me twice.
Letho, No insult worthy of scum like you.
Louis," Careful, men! They're witchers!"
Bandit, Witchers don't attack humans!
Letho, Make an exception for you.
Letho, Lie still or you'll bleed to death. Tell me where Vester's men are. I'll
Louis, Th-they're north of here. In Lindenvale.
Geralt," Don't believe you, somehow."
Louis," Why would I lie? Letho, you gotta forgive me. It weren't nothin'"
Geralt," I'm curious -- how much does the life of an ""old mate"" get you these"
Louis, Things... Things been shite of late... And we fell afoul o' the Black
Letho, I understand.
Louis, Hey! My medicine!
Letho," Gotta understand, Louis. You don't betray men like me. Time to see"
Geralt, Going with you.
Louis, Damn you! Whoresons!
Geralt, Arnout Vester...Nilfgaardian name.
Letho," From Metinna, I think. But he's hunted and killed everywhere from the"
Geralt, Why have I never heard of him?
Letho," Goon goes by different names -- Brenden Vilfe, Appo Saxon, Manfred"
Geralt, Manfred Whimplebottoms? Good name for a clown.
Letho, Ones he's done in sure weren't laughing. Preferred method -- rip the
Geralt, Quite the career. Underworld to serving the emperor and his court.
Letho, Yeah... Scum does usually float to the top.
Letho, Keep your eyes open.
Geralt, Think they're really here?
Letho," Don't know. But like I said, I've grown real careful."
Letho, Nice mounts...
Geralt, Gotta be worth more than the entire village.
Letho, What's in the barn?
Boy, H-h-hay.
Letho, Got company?
Letho," Run and find your parents. Tell them to grab whatever's valuable, take"
Geralt, What was that?
Letho, Compensation. Stay here. And don't interfere -- no matter what happens.
Bandit, What in the blazes?
Bandit, A bolt o' lightning or somethin'?
Vester," Shut up, all of you!"
Vester, Letho of Gulet... Good to see you alive and well.
Letho, Funny. Second time today I've heard that lie.
Vester, It is no lie. You will certainly fetch a higher bounty alive.
Letho, Really. How much?
Vester," Enough to buy me an estate in Kovir, where I will lie about eating"
Letho, Not bad. Not every man gets to know the price on his head.
Vester, Most men would prefer not to have one. But why have you come? To make
Letho, We were passing by... Decided it was time to finally meet the famous
Vester, I am flattered. Shame we'll not get to know one another better.
Letho, Why? Going somewhere?
Vester, No. Simply because I will kill you in a moment.
Letho," Wanna kill me, but you don't even know me. Not nice. Think I have to"
Vester, Bloody hell! You fucking dimwit! I hadn't time to exchange two words
Bandit, He provoked me!
Vester," We have no quarrel with you, but one false move and--"
Geralt, And what?
Vester, You will end like him. What say you to that?
Geralt, What do I say? Simple -- you're good as dead.
Geralt," You go your way, I'll go mine."
Vester, Wise choice. Take his head. And we leave this gods forsaken¹ place.
Geralt," His head stays where it is. Instead, I'll take yours."
Geralt, You're not taking anything. Need proof? Take his medallion.
Vester," We will take his head. You are one, we are three."
Geralt," Mhm, but in the time it took me to run up, Letho dropped six of"
Vester," Ben, take the medallion. The head could rot before we arrived at our"
Geralt," Mff-mff. Hm, Zanguebarian venom. Something's fishy..."
Letho, Akh akh akh... You still here?
Geralt, Huh. They'd 'ave cut your head off if I hadn't been here.
Letho," Hm, so you proved useful after all."
Geralt, Coulda told me.
Letho," Heh, no fun in that."
Geralt, Find this amusing?
Letho," Not so loud, Geralt. I just rose from the dead."
Geralt," Zanguebarian venom could still kill you, you know."
Geralt," You all right? You're conscious, but that Zanguebarian venom could"
Geralt, Got the antidote?
Letho," Mhm, saddlebag. Take it in a minute. Couple of days, I'll be like new."
Geralt, What was it for? That whole farce.
Letho," Told you, I'd been on the run since Loc Muinne. Loads of pursuers... Got"
Geralt, What if he'd crossed you? Like Louis?
Letho, I had to risk it.
Geralt, What about Louis? Was he part of this plan?
Letho," Nah, a minor complication. Ah-ahh, though his betrayal, it did get me"
Letho, Gotta say it's paid off. Letho of Gulet's dead as a doornail -- word

Geralt, Wouldn't 'ave done it if you'd let me in on your plan.
Letho," Told you not to get involved. Well, my plans¹ in shambles. I should"
Geralt, Hmm... You could wait things out at Kaer Morhen.
Letho," With your friends from the School of the Wolf? Hah. No, thanks, could"
Geralt," Tell 'em I sent you. They'll understand, give you space."
Letho," Kaer Morhen, you say... Hmm, why not? Got some loose ends to tie up,"
Geralt, Help you somehow? Need anything?
Letho," No, thanks. I'll be fine."
Geralt," So, see you at Kaer Morhen."
Letho," See you, Wolf."
Geralt," Gotta be a cozy haunted house nearby. You can lay low, and no one'll"

Geralt, Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Geralt, A means to solve your troubles.

Hunter, Everything. Anything. It's an old elven temple. The witch Eilhart
Geralt, Any of your men still down there?
Hunter," Dozen or so went in, they's all that came out. Rest're probably dead."
Geralt, Time I saw if Philippa's still in there...
Hunter, Don't count on anyone goin' in to retrieve your corpse.
Geralt, Gotta be some mechanism that opens this door.
Geralt, Missing one tile.
Geralt, Perfect hideout -- for an owl... Be a bit harder for me to move around.
Geralt, Hate portals. Make my stomach turn.

Geralt, Be a good little hunter and give me the crystal.
Hunter, I am a good little hunter. There you go.
Geralt, No time to argue. Gimme the crystal.
Hunter, Over my dead body!
Geralt, Have it your way...
Hunter, Right! Enough! I'll give you the damned crystal.
Geralt, Outta my way.
Geralt, What's the big event that's supposed to happen?
Hunter," Uhhh... Don't know the details, but I came across Philippa Eilhart's"

Hunter, And then he opened the portal and pranced through.
Hunter, You shoulda gone after him!
Hunter," Straight into the monster's jaws? Preferred to come up, inform you."
Hunter, You're alive...? Find anything?
Geralt," Cremated notes, a nekker nest, rats... Nothing interesting."
Hunter, Why don't I believe you?
Geralt," Dunno. Your problem, I guess."
Hunter," Oh, you're wrong there..."

Hunter," Hand it over, whatever you found. We'll see the king gets it."
Geralt, Forgetting yourself. Save your orders for your men.
Hunter, As you wish... Grab him!
Geralt, So be it... But to the king directly. Straight into his hands.
Hunter, You can be sure o' that...
Hunter, Let's go!
Geralt, Spoke with Radovid... Offered me a contract -- to find Philippa.
Triss, The bastard...wasn't enough he poked her eyes out? Probably wants to
Geralt, No.
Triss," Geralt, you know what he did to her..."
Geralt," Relax. See, I figured if I agreed, I could look for her without his men"
Triss, So? Learn anything?
Geralt, Even better. Found this.
Geralt, A bit. Seems she hid in some elven ruins outside Novigrad after she
Triss," A megascope crystal. Hm, it's damaged...but it could still work."
Rita, ...and Francesca's equally hesitant. Neither she nor Ida wishes to decide

Rita, Fringilla's on our side. She'll join us as soon as she's finished some

Philippa," Yennefer's never belonged to the lodge, and Triss... Well, we shall"

Triss, That's it. That's all I could recover.
Geralt," Hm, guessing Radovid would love to get his hands on this..."
Geralt, I get that right? Philippa say she wants to restore her vision?
Triss, Seems she was planning to grow tissue on precious stones.
Geralt, Makes sense. Found agates covered in blood in her hideout.
Triss," If she pulled it off, she'd only be the second person in the world to"
Geralt," Meaning what, exactly?"
Triss, The names they mentioned -- all the most powerful sorceresses. Former
Geralt, That good or bad?
Triss," Depends for who. Philippa's always said that ""if magic perishes, so"
Geralt," ""Our"" opinions? You'd join them really?"
Triss," No, I've got other plans. So, what will you do with the crystal?"
Geralt, Haven't decided... Bet Radovid would be very interested in it...
Triss," You're not gonna give it to him, are you?"
Geralt, Probably better if you keep it.
Triss, Much better. It'll be safe with me. I'll try to cast a diagnostic
Geralt, Good luck.
Geralt," Don't see why not. I was supposed to bring him Philippa, true, but"
Triss," I sincerely hope you're not serious. Radovid hates mages, Philippa"
Geralt, It's not like they said anything specific.
Triss, Radovid is holding mages captive. He'll force them to extract more

Radovid, A fitting end for a witch.
Geralt," Wasn't where your men said, but I did find signs of someone doing"
Radovid," Oh, that's something."
Geralt, Think Philippa tried to restore her eyesight.
Radovid, Verily? Empty eye sockets suit her so much better.
Radovid, So. Have you any proof?
Geralt, Got this crystal.
Geralt, No. But you have my word.
Radovid," Hahah, your word? You give me your word? Sorry, but Eilhart herself"
Geralt, Crystal from her megascope. I gave it to your men.
Radovid, How curious. They claimed to have found it themselves. And to have
Geralt, They lied. They'd lost over a dozen men by the time I arrived. I gave
Radovid, Your word against theirs. And you've no proof.
